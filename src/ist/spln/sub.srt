00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,500
The Why of Fry

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,100
by Joke0

4
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Delivery boy, Phillip J. Fry, reporting for duty.

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine.

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,500
What's the meaning of this, we've got to
delivery people. Let's move, let's move.

7
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,700
Amy, mission fore file.

8
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Interesting

9
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,000
- Dr Zoidberg, mission bag.
- Packed and ready, sir.

10
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,400
What this? This is the same toy
surprising at last time!

11
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,300
I can't work under these conditions,
without me there is no mission.

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,700
I AM the mission!

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,200
We're back from the mission.

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,500
Wha, what? You went without me?

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,100
You were looking up cursewords in the
dictionary, it seemed like a better
use of your time.

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,850
But...But, I'm the delivery boy!

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,400
Don't worry, everything went fine.

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,700
Better than usual.

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,300
We got medals.

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Good work team! We've really
pulled together on this one.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,100
They got medals.

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm really sorry I missed the mission.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,300
- I wasn't there, you might have needed me.
- Nope.

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,350
- But if I'd been there, I...
- Nope.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,800
- Look ...
- Nope.

26
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,850
- Bender is great.
- Nope.

27
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,500
Listen, Leela. Let me make it up by
taking you out for dinner tonight.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
No.

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,100
I got a date with Chaz.

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,100
Chaz!?

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,600
I met him at that charity
cock-fight last week.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,400
He's the major's aide.

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,800
You go, mutant girl!

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,200
I do go, he's a very important man.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,800
So? I'm just as important as him.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,100
It's just that, the kind of importance I have...
it doesn't matter if I ... don't do it.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
I'm nobody.

38
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,700
There are guys in the background of Mary
Worth comics who are more important than me.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Buck up meat loaf, Bender will take you
out tonight and cheer you up.

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,600
What do you want to do?
And I mean anything!

41
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,400
You have the power.
Name it and I'm there.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,600
You're the man.

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,300
Well...OK. Let's go bowling.

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
No.

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,700
Table for two? Step right this way.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,100
I'm afraid we don't have a reservation, but...

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,500
as you can see,

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,100
I'm the mayor's aide!
Table for two, please!

49
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Okay, then...

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,500
It's OK my man, I've got you covered on
your next health inspection.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,300
I really appreciate that mister mayor's aide.

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,850
Here you go.

53
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,650
Compliments on the house.

54
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,450
Free bread of the restaurant! Is there
anything you can't do?

55
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,600
I can't fail the mayor.

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Not ever.

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,100
Jeez! Better not let Leela see me.

58
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Hey, I hear Fry!

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,350
Boy, I'm glad you here.

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,150
You are? So things aren't working out
with what's-his-name?

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,750
Actually...they are...

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,550
Confidentally I might not make it
back at my appartement tonight.

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,600
Could you up Nibbler for me?

64
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,300
And bring a baggie in case he
drops a steamer.

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
Have a great night!

66
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Oh no! Please no!

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,100
Perfect.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,300
Smells like a 289 in progress.

69
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Failure to scoop...Oh yeah!

70
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Wait! I'm trying. It weight as much
as a thousand suns.

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Don't worry Fry, I'll pull some strings and
see if I can get you trialed as juvenile.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Oh Chaz!

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm as worthless as this trash can.

74
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,000
You think I'm as worthless as you?

75
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,100
Try catching garbage in your head and
raising six kids, you dumb townie!

76
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,100
At least I'm important to you, even if it's
only because I clean up your poop.

77
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,300
The poop eradication is but one
aspect of your importance!

78
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
- Did you just talk?
- Indeed.

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,400
And I have other amazing powers as well.

80
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Like what?

81
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,700
Are you my mommy?

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,300
Negative.

83
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,500
Welcome Lord Nibbler.

84
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,250
Welcome Acknowledged.

85
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I bring with me...the Mighty One.

86
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,100
At last! Our centuries upon centuries
of waiting have achieved fruition.

87
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Aren’t you a fuzzy wuzzy wittle guy.

88
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,800
Stop that!

89
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,500
Please...Your Mightiness

90
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got
kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs.

91
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,500
Does he not know?

92
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,800
He does not know.

93
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
He knows not?

94
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,900
Knows not does he.

95
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
- Not he knows?
- Enough!

96
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the
fate of humanity, the fate of our race,

97
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,200
indeed, the fate of all that exists
and ever will exist,

98
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
rest with you

99
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,700
You are the single most important
person in the universe.

100
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,900
Oh! Snap!

101
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
On this auspicious occasion,

102
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,100
let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast!

103
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
The feast of a thousand beasts is begun.

104
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
- You're gonna eat that?
- Maybe later.

105
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,400
The time has come to discuss matters
of the gravest importance.

106
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,500
Fry, do you remember some months ago
when Earth was attack by flying brains?

107
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,150
I remember the square dancing stomachs.

108
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Or that might be in the lately commercials.

109
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,800
Wait! The brains! I do remember!

110
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
But no one else does, they said I was crazy

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
On the contrary, you remember because
you were the only one immune to the brains
mental attack.

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,700
Because I'm so smart?

113
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,900
Oh my!

114
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,000
Anyway. Your immunity is due to the fact
that you lack the delta brain wave.

115
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,000
It's a genetic abnormality which resulted
when you went back in time and performed
certain actions

116
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,500
which made you your own grandfather.

117
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,700
I did do the nasty in the pasty!

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,300
Verily. And that past nastification is what
shields you from the brains.

119
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,700
You are the last hope of the universe.

120
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,350
So, I really am important?

121
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,050
How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

122
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band
doesn't rock.

123
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,000
For a 1000 years the evil brains have been
constructing the infosphere.

124
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,500
A giant memory bank twice the size
of 3 ordinary memory banks.

125
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
What so evil about that?

126
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,400
They plan to collect all the information in
the universe and store it within the sphere.

127
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,800
So they try to learn things?

128
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,700
- Right.
- Those bastards!

129
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Being brains, they feel compelled
to know everything

130
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,700
and soon they will.

131
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
I'm as mad as I've ever been.

132
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Once their task is complete, they will ensure
that no new information arises in the only
way possible

133
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,900
by destroying the universe.

134
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,900
Now, it's personnal!

135
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,800
Your mission is to infiltrate the infosphere
and plant this quantum interphase bomb,

136
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,900
blasting them into an alternate universe,
from which there is no return.

137
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,900
Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff, Jr.

138
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
OK, let's go through this once more...

139
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Brains!

140
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,400
Fear not, Mighty One.

141
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Your missing brain wave makes you invisible
to them. So long as you avoid intense thinking.

142
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,700
Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.

143
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,350
- That is most wise.
- Who?

144
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,100
In a few seconds, the brains will finish
scanning the last bits of information
in the universe.

145
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,600
Beavers made for life

146
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
11 greater than 4.

147
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,600
For quality carpets visit Kaplan's
carpet warehouse

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,100
Now, the infospere will open
is protective crust.

149
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,100
So it's to scan itself,

150
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,500
completing its thousands years task.

151
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,400
This is your one chance to enter the sphere,

152
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,700
Scoot, scoot now.

153
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,200
I'am at the input console. I'm a little nervous
and I've got brain in my but-crack.

154
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Roger.

155
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,700
Once you press the detonator, you will have
60 seconds for an exciting escape.

156
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,500
Eh wait! Those brain knows everything
about everything, right?

157
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,350
It will soon, that's why you're supposed
to be setting off the bomb.

158
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,100
Yeah yeah. But I can't pass up
the chance to learn the answers

159
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,800
to the greatest questions of all time.

160
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,700
- Is it true that post stamp glue is made of...
- Correct! Toad mucus.

161
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,300
There's no time for this, activate the bomb!

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,900
Wait, wait, wait.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,800
What really killed the dinosaurs?

164
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Me!

165
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,000
Detecting trace amounts of mental activity,

166
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,200
possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.

167
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,250
You gross, cut it out!

168
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,400
Odd...He is immune to our psionic attack!

169
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Impossible, we are an ambitious young
squad with everything to prove!

170
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,400
It appears we are in presence
of the fabled one.

171
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:39,200
But without his Scooty-Puff, Jr.,
he cannot escape.

172
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,250
A quantum interphase bomb?
Are you insane in the membrane?

173
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,450
You got it point, Dexter.

174
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,050
Not good.

175
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,150
Detonation in T-60 earth seconds.

176
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,500
You fool! You'll be transported into
the other universe with us.

177
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,500
Trapped there for all eternity.

178
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,300
And we'll form a tightly nitted clique
that you wont be part of.

179
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,500
At least, I did one important thing with my life!

180
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,700
leading good to victory over evil.

181
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,900
- Hourray!
- Exactly!

182
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,250
The Nibblonians? Good?

183
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,700
During your last moments in this universe

184
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,650
perhaps you should query our database
concerning the night of December, 31st 1999.

185
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,750
The day I got frozen? What about it?

186
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,050
No! Don't ask about that,
euh...it...it would be...boring.

187
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,100
Forget it then...

188
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,900
Query!

189
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,050
What append to me Phillip J. Fry on
the night of December, 31st 1999?

190
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,700
Clarification request! Are you
the Phillip J. Fry from Earth,

191
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
or the Phillip J fry from Howering
Squid World 97A?

192
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,900
Earth, you fat idiot. Hurry up.

193
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,300
Hello! Pizza delivery for...

194
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,250
Oh, crud

195
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,050
I can't believe how fat I look!

196
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,900
Ooh, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?!

197
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,850
What the...

198
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,650
I...I don't understand, you made me
go in the freezer tube?

199
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,750
Detonation in T-15 seconds.

200
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,650
You're the one frozing me!
You took away my life.

201
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,850
We can explain.

202
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,250
No, you can't! Shut your adorable trap.

203
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,950
We had no choice. You were the only
one who could help us.

204
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,650
What is one life weighed against
the entire universe?

205
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,700
But it was my life.

206
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,850
Detonation in 2, 1... will the owner
of the white Pontiac Firebird...

207
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,900
Nevermind, zero.

208
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,150
Well, here we are trapped for eternity.

209
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,900
We could sing 'American Pie'.

210
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,700
Go ahead, I deserve it.

211
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,900
I wish the stupid racoons had never
brought me to the future.

212
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,850
I have shocking data relevant
to this conversation.

213
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,500
We don't care, you dope. We're in an other
universe, you're not in charge anymore.

214
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,150
It is possible for the Phillip Fry to resume
his life on the December, 31st 1999.

215
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,050
Really? I can go back in time?

216
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,250
There is an access point between universes
at the space time where you enter the cryogenic tube,

217
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,000
you and only you can return there.

218
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,400
Interesting. You could stop the nibblonian
from pushing you into the cryogenic tube.

219
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,000
That IS interesting. Why?

220
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,800
It would be as you never came to the future.

221
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,550
You'll have your life back,

222
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,300
and we will succeed in our plan to
understand and destroy the universe.

223
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,700
Everybody wins!

224
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,300
The human will be returned to the past.

225
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,300
Meanwhile...

226
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,600
I love rocket skating but the
wait is always so long.

227
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,350
Poor Fry once stood on line
6 hours to get me a ticket.

228
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,850
6 hours! Psss. Sounds like a real nobody.

229
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,350
But now it's time for somebody, and
some chick he is with, to go skating.

230
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,350
You reserved the whole ring!

231
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,450
Yep! Buzzed ahead let then know whose
aide is coming by. The Mayor's, that whose.

232
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,650
Mr Vogel, I thought we were going skating?

233
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,900
No, we're not important enough,

234
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,250
everybody just hold hands until the bus
driver comes back from his haircut.

235
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Let's let those kids skate with us.

236
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,050
What! Seriously?

237
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,700
I'm trying to impress you here.

238
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,500
I know, and it's working. But think how much
skating would mean to those kids.

239
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,900
We came here instead of eating today.

240
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,700
This might be the only chance
to skate here their all lives.

241
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,200
Who are we to say they can't?

242
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,000
The mayor's aide...and his badge.

243
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,050
Beat it kids, come back when
you got connections.

244
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,800
Alright, little ones. Back to the orphanarium.

245
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,050
You can slide around the gym in your socks.

246
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,850
What socks?

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,450
So, am I getting lucky tonight or what?

248
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,250
I hope your calculations are correct!

249
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,600
Our calculations are always correct
for we are gigantic brains.

250
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,200
Initiate: space time transfer.

251
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,000
I hereby place an order for one cheese pizza.

252
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,450
One pie, nothing good on it? Name?

253
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,050
I period C period Wiener.

254
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,100
Talk a little louder, it sounds like you've some
kind of tiny head on ya or something

255
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,200
Hello, pizza delivery for ...

256
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Crud!

257
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,700
Gotcha!

258
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,100
I don't understand.

259
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,650
Yes you do. You came back in time
to knock me into that freezer.

260
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,600
and now, I came back in time to stop you!

261
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,050
I did not come back in time.
My people lack that ability.

262
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,100
But... I know you in the future.
I cleaned your poop!

263
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,050
Quite possible. We live long
and are celebrated poopers!

264
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,550
You will meet me when I'm
a thousand years older.

265
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,900
Not if you don't freeze me!

266
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,800
Please! Our sages foresee that in a
thousand years, for one moment,

267
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,350
the fate of the universe will depend on you!

268
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,800
Since you will not live that long,
I must freeze you now.

269
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,550
Why could you not just ask me?

270
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,450
We were affraid you would refuse.

271
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,750
Of course not! I love the future.

272
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,800
So then...why are you choking me right now?

273
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,800
Because I don't like being used.

274
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,300
Well, now it's your choice.

275
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,900
Is there nothing in the future worth saving?

276
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,950
Leela. But she doesn't think much of me..

277
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
She must be The Other.

278
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,700
Wh...wha?

279
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,500
You must not give up on her.

280
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm stationed on a distant
world known as Vergon 6.

281
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,800
But if you return to the future,

282
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,850
I will tranfer to Earth to give
you what help I can.

283
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,000
You really think I would have
had a chance with Leela?

284
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,600
You must choose. The present or the future.

285
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,600
To save youself or save Leela.

286
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes! Here I come future!

287
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,700
No wait, I'm getting trapped
in the infosphere again.

288
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,450
Just remember that Scooty-Puff, Jr. suckssss...

289
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,350
In a thousand years I'll get right on it.

290
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,700
And so, a thousand years later,

291
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,050
Fry, once again, infiltrated the infosphere
and set off his amazing bomb.

292
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,650
Only this time...

293
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,350
Thank you for saving the universe, Fry.

294
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,400
- Here.
- Thanks.

295
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,000
If you ever need a saviour again, just ask.

296
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,400
Oh, we will,

297
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
we will.

298
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,500
Man! I can't wait to tell everyone
what happened.

299
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Yes. Incidentally,

300
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,800
I need to remain under cover so I'm...

301
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
...blanking your memory.

302
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,700
Did everything just taste purple for a second?

303
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,450
Well, let's go home you dump poop machine.

304
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,650
Bender, would you do the honors...

305
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,750
With gusto.

306
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,200
Guess I got this for you.

307
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Oh! Thank you.

308
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,050
You know what Fry? I don't care if you're not
the most important person in the universe.

309
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,850
It really makes me happy to see you right now.

310
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,700
Then I am the most important
person in the universe.

311
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,750
YES!
