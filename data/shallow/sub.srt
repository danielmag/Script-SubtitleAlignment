1
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:54,627
I'm not ashamed. I've known love.

2
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:57,171
I've known rejection.

3
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:00,091
I'm not afraid to declare my feelings.

4
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:06,138
DAVID          (VOICE-OVER):Take trust, for instance, or friendship.
These are the important things in life.

5
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:10,768
DAVID          (VOICE-OVER):These are the things that matter,
that help you on your way.

6
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:17,483
DAVID          (VOICE-OVER):If you can't trust your friends,
well what then? What then?

7
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:21,320
DAVID          (VOICE-OVER):This could have been any city.

8
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,783
DAVID          (VOICE-OVER):They're all the same.

9
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,705
CAMERON:Hello. I've come about the room.

10
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,174
ALEX:- So what's his name?
DAVID:- I don't know. Campbell or something.

11
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:08,219
JULIET:- Cameron.
ALEX:- Cameron? Really?

12
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:10,763
CAMERON:That's right.

13
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:13,474
ALEX          (to Cameron):What?

14
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:15,976
ALEX          (CONTINUED):- Are you comfortable?
CAMERON:- Yes, thanks.

15
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:18,270
ALEX:- Have you seen the flat?
CAMERON:- Yes.

16
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,232
ALEX:- And you like it?
CAMERON:- Yes, it's great.

17
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:24,276
ALEX:We all like it. The room's nice,
too, don't you think?

18
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:28,322
ALEX:Spacious, bright, all that sort of stuff,
all that sort of crap.

19
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:30,032
CAMERON:Well, yes.

20
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:33,703
ALEX:So tell me, cos I'd like to know,
what on earth could make you think...

21
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:36,622
ALEX:we'd want to share this flat
with someone like you?

22
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:41,836
My first impression is that you have none
of the qualities we seek from a flatmate.

23
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:45,631
I'm talking about things like presence,
charisma, style and charm.

24
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,218
I don't think we're asking too much,
or being unreasonable.

25
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:53,389
Take David here. An accountant
he may be, but at least he tries hard.

26
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,726
Trouble is, I just don't think you're trying.

27
00:03:56,976 --> 00:04:01,856
Hey, Cameron, I mean this. Good luck.

28
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:13,951
DAVID:- Just a few questions.
ALEX:- What about your hobbies?

29
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,203
JULIET:- Why do you want a room here?
DAVID:- Do you smoke?

30
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:20,249
ALEX:When you sacrifice a goat and rip
its heart out, do you summon hellfire?

31
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:24,420
It's a straightforward question.
Either you're divorced or you're not.

32
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,299
ALEX:- Or do you just send out for a pizza?
- Do a little freebase, maybe?

33
00:04:28,549 --> 00:04:31,135
How do you decide
which shade of black to wear?

34
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,638
DAVID:OK, I'm going to play you
just a few seconds of this tape.

35
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:37,224
DAVID:Name the song, the lead singer...

36
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:44,940
DAVID:and three hit singles subsequently
recorded by him with another band.

37
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:55,868
ALEX:Let me get this straight.
This affair that you're "not" having...

38
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:58,412
JULIET:is it not with a man
or not with a woman?

39
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:01,123
DAVID:Turning very briefly
to corporate financing...

40
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:05,669
DAVID:No, this is important. Leveraged buyouts:
A good or a bad thing?

41
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,547
ALEX:When did anyone last
say to you these exact words:

42
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:12,593
ALEX:"You are the sunshine of my life"?

43
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:18,391
JULIET:And how would you react, then,
if I told you I was the Antichrist?

44
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:25,981
Do you like my picture?

45
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:38,369
ALEX:Defeat. Defeat. Defeat.

46
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:45,042
ALEX:Sporting, personal, financial,
professional, sexual and everything.

47
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:49,130
ALEX:Next.

48
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,263
ALEX:- Did you know that...?
JULIET:- Alex. Just serve.

49
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:04,145
ALEX:Anyway, I wasn't tryin' to win. I
don't want to devalue your victory, Juliet.

50
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:07,523
ALEX          (CONTINUED):- I wasn't tryin' to win.
DAVID:- Victory's the same as defeat.

51
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:09,692
DAVID:It's giving in to destructive urges.

52
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:12,653
ALEX:Did you learn that in
your psychotherapy group?

53
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:15,865
DAVID:- Discussion group.
JULIET:- I thought you'd stopped going.

54
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:20,703
ALEX:He had too many of those urges.
You of all people should know about that.

55
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:23,164
ALEX          (CONTINUED):God, you two are sensitive.

56
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:27,334
ALEX          (CONTINUED):All I'm doing is implying some
kind of ugly, sordid, sexual liaison.

57
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:30,171
ALEX          (CONTINUED):- I'd be proud of that.
JULIET:- Maybe you should go.

58
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:33,007
JULIET:- You'll meet someone wonderful.
ALEX:- For my life?

59
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:36,510
ALEX:- A discussion group? I think not.
JULIET:- For the flat.

60
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:40,514
ALEX:No, it'd be someone like him,
and one's enough, thank you very much.

61
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:44,810
ALEX:What about that girl? That friend of yours,
the one that came round. I liked her.

62
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:48,397
ALEX:We had something. She could have
moved in. We had chemistry.

63
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:50,566
JULIET:- She hated you...
ALEX:- She had problems.

64
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:55,446
JULIET:More than anyone
she had ever met in her entire life.

65
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:59,283
ALEX:Like they say, you know, she's
got to want to change, hasn't she?

66
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:13,255
JULIET:- You must be Hugo.
HUGO:- And you must be Juliet.

67
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:18,427
JULIET:- Would you like to come in?
HUGO:- I'd be delighted.

68
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:27,061
JULIET:- What do you do?
HUGO:- I've been away for a while.

69
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,189
HUGO:Travelling. And now I'm writing a novel.

70
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:36,362
JULIET:- What's it about?
HUGO:- It's actually about a priest who dies.

71
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,572
JULIET:I see.

72
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:42,159
HUGO:Maybe you're right. Maybe
I ought to change it. You're right.

73
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,746
HUGO:I mean, who wants to read
another story about a dead priest?

74
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:50,209
HUGO:In fact, it's about another guy,
he's not a priest, and he lives.

75
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,213
HUGO:He doesn't die. See? It's better already.

76
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:57,425
JULIET:- Writing seems easy.
HUGO:- It's a breeze. No problem.

77
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:10,479
JULIET:Do you think you could answer that?

78
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:16,027
HUGO:- What, the telephone?
JULIET:- But... if it's for me, I'm not here.

79
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:20,322
JULIET:Right. You're not here.

80
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:25,161
OK.

81
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,668
HUGO:Hello?

82
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:37,548
HUGO:Yes, it is, yes. Who's calling, please?

83
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:43,220
HUGO:Well, I'm sorry, but she's not...
she's not in right now.

84
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:47,016
HUGO:No, I've got absolutely no idea.

85
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:50,019
HUGO:Would you like to leave a message?

86
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,856
OK. Goodbye.

87
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:59,070
HUGO          (CONTINUED):That was a guy called Brian.

88
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,114
JULIET:- Did he sound upset?
HUGO:- A little bit, yeah.

89
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:05,076
HUGO:- Is that good or bad?
JULIET:- It's an improvement.

90
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:07,787
HUGO:Shall I get the phone?

91
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:11,957
JULIET:Just leave it. He knows I'm probably
at home. I'm working nights this week.

92
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,919
HUGO:- You're working nights?
JULIET:- I'm a doctor.

93
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,966
HUGO:- And he's a patient?
JULIET:- No, but he needs treatment.

94
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:23,552
HUGO:- For what?
JULIET:- A certain weakness.

95
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:27,431
HUGO:- The human condition.
JULIET:- Oh. You know about it.

96
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:32,395
HUGO:- Well, I write about it.
JULIET:- And that's not the same thing?

97
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:36,315
HUGO:No. I'm like all novelists -
on a search of the self.

98
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:39,068
ALEX:Has he tried
down the back of the fridge?

99
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:41,487
JULIET:ALEX:He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.

100
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:44,532
ALEX:I'm not saying
he didn't seem like a nice guy.

101
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:48,369
ALEX:I just said it's a bit strange,
this search of the self or whatever.

102
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,996
JULIET:He didn't seem strange, Alex.

103
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:56,669
JULIET:He seemed... you know...

104
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,881
JULIET:- Interesting.
ALEX:- Interesting?

105
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:09,098
ALEX:Interesting.

106
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:17,398
ALEX:Hello? No, she's not in.

107
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:20,151
ALEX:I don't know. I've no idea.

108
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,820
JULIET:- Who was it?
ALEX:- I don't know. He sounded Swedish.

109
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,407
ALEX:- Do you know any Swedish men?
- No.

110
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:28,784
ALEX:Maybe it was just the emotion.

111
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:31,287
ALEX          (CONTINUED):- What do you think?
DAVID:- About what?

112
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:34,081
ALEX:- About this Hugo person.
DAVID:- I don't have the time.

113
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:38,085
ALEX:- I'm just asking what you think.
DAVID:- I don't care, so long as he's not a freak.

114
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:41,756
ALEX:David. It's your mother's
handwriting. I didn't open it.

115
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:45,509
ALEX:I don't like reading about
your father's constipation.

116
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,679
JULIET:- So we'll meet him, then?
ALEX:- What?

117
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:54,310
ALEX:Yeah, yeah, whatever. I tell you, every
letter this guy writes you is the same.

118
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,938
ALEX:They all begin like true love
and descend into open pornography.

119
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:02,151
ALEX:"I dream of your thighs, the touch of
your white skin leading me in desire...

120
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:08,407
ALEX          (CONTINUED):ALEX:while I, aroused and inflamed..."
Aroused and inflamed?

121
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,206
ALEX:He even signs them in his own name.

122
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:20,586
ALEX:I'd sign someone else's. I'd sign his name.
If I wrote them, that is, which I don't.

123
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:23,214
ALEX:Interesting. That's what she said.

124
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:25,925
ALEX:Interesting. You see,
that's why you're here.

125
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:29,178
DAVID:I don't usually meet people,
unless I already know them.

126
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:31,847
HUGO:- I see.
DAVID:- People can be so cruel.

127
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,308
ALEX:So...

128
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:37,520
HUGO:well, we think it's fine.

129
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,855
ALEX          (CONTINUED):So, I can have the room?

130
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:43,234
JULIET:- Yes, you can have the room.
ALEX:- I'm not usually drunk.

131
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:46,696
JULIET:- Not usually this drunk.
DAVID:- Only on expenses.

132
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:49,615
ALEX:He's going to tell you
he could have been someone.

133
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:53,577
JULIET:Instead of what he is, which is
the man we know and love.

134
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:57,915
ALEX:Tired out, empty shell of a...
Know and love?

135
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:01,043
ALEX:- I think you're lying.
JULIET:- You're right.

136
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:07,883
ALEX:- You see? They don't really know me.
JULIET:- No, Alex. We don't really love you.

137
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,887
ALEX:Can you afford this place?

138
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:15,725
HUGO:Oh, yeah.

139
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:23,983
DAVID:- Can I ask you a question?
HUGO:- Certainly.

140
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,612
DAVID:Have you ever killed a man?

141
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:36,787
DAVID:No.

142
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,128
DAVID:That's fair enough, then.

143
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:57,391
ALEX:Well, it certainly smells like the real thing.

144
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,670
JULIET:Rangers have made a few
dramatic comebacks this season.

145
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,968
But they'll really have to
draw on all of their resources.

146
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,224
JULIET:- Have you seen Hugo?
ALEX:- No.

147
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:23,102
ALEX:Any idea which channel he's on?

148
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:26,647
The High Court in Edinburgh.

149
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:29,650
Oh, for fuck's sake.

150
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:40,369
No, she's not in.

151
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:51,297
ALEX          (CONTINUED):- Have you seen him?
DAVID:- I don't have the time.

152
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:56,177
ALEX:- Yes or no? David, yes or...?
ALEX:- No!

153
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,848
ALEX:- David hasn't seen him either.
JULIET:- So I gathered.

154
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:02,767
ALEX:- Maybe he didn't like us.
JULIET:- David?

155
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:06,395
ALEX:- No, Hugo.
JULIET:- His car's still there.

156
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:09,940
ALEX:- He's got a car?
JULIET:- Yeah. What's wrong with that?

157
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,985
ALEX:- What sort of car?
JULIET:- I don't know, Alex. I'm just a girl.

158
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:15,363
ALEX:I'll ask you once more. What sort of car?

159
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:20,326
JULIET:A blue one, OK? And it's still there.

160
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:36,842
ALEX:Hugo, I'm sorry about this,
but can you open your door?

161
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:42,681
ALEX:It's us, your flatmates and companions,
your new-found friends.

162
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:46,686
ALEX:- He's not there. I can't see him at all.
ALEX:- Maybe he's in the wardrobe.

163
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:49,105
Of course he's not
in the bloody wardrobe.

164
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:52,692
- It's a joke, Alex.
ALEX:- I think he probably left.

165
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:58,030
ALEX:- We'll probably never see him again.
JULIET:- Alex, the key is on the other side.

166
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,908
ALEX:- So?
JULIET:- Open it.

167
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:03,077
ALEX:You want me to kick this in? Now?

168
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,123
- Yeah.
ALEX:- OK, no problem.

169
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:18,592
ALEX          (CONTINUED):Do you want a go?

170
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:23,556
OK, you size that up.

171
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:51,792
DAVID:- Is this what they always look like?
JULIET:- Yes.

172
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:55,337
ALEX:- Wonder how he did it.
JULIET:- Did what?

173
00:16:55,588 --> 00:17:00,593
ALEX:Killed himself.
I presume that's what's happened.

174
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,762
ALEX:What do you think?

175
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:05,598
JULIET:- Alex!
ALEX:- What? What's wrong?

176
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:07,683
JULIET:- What are you doing?
ALEX:- Looking.

177
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:09,518
JULIET:- Don't.
ALEX:- Don't look?

178
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,812
JULIET:- No.
ALEX:- Why not?

179
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,607
ALEX:What's wrong? Don't you
wonder what he died from?

180
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:19,570
JULIET:No. The guy's dead.
What more do you need?

181
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,491
ALEX:It's not every day
I find a story in my own flat.

182
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:28,579
JULIET:It's not a story, Alex, it's a corpse.

183
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:34,960
DAVID:I've never seen a dead body before.

184
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:46,889
JULIET:I saw my grandmother, of course,
but I don't suppose that counts.

185
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:50,810
DAVID:She was alive at the time.

186
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:10,746
ALEX:Can I show you something?

187
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:23,884
OPERATOR:Emergency. Which service?

188
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:27,596
Emergency. Which...?

189
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:34,145
DAVID:- No.
ALEX:- Just think about it.

190
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:36,480
DAVID:- No.
ALEX:- Come on, David.

191
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:38,983
DAVID:- No.
ALEX:- Juliet?

192
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:42,111
JULIET:- No, Alex. It's...
ALEX:JULIET:- It's what?

193
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:44,071
JULIET:- Unfeasible.
ALEX:- Is that all?

194
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,574
DAVID:- You mean immoral.
ALEX:- I know what I mean.

195
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:51,162
ALEX:- I'm only asking you to think about it.
DAVID:- It's a sick idea, Alex. It's sick.

196
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:55,082
ALEX:But don't tell me you're not tempted.
Don't tell me you're not interested.

197
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:59,211
ALEX:- I know you well enough.
DAVID:- You think so?

198
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:08,095
ALEX:Go ahead, then. Telephone.

199
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:12,266
ALEX:Telephone the police.

200
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:14,810
ALEX:Go ahead. No one's gonna
stand in your way.

201
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:17,146
ALEX:Telephone them. Tell them.

202
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:23,903
ALEX:Tell them there's a suitcase full
of money, and you don't want it.

203
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,349
ALEX:? My baby don't care for shows

204
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,396
? My baby don't care for clothes

205
00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:03,693
? My baby just cares for me

206
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:09,824
? My baby don't care for

207
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:13,619
? Cars and races

208
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:17,748
? My baby don't care for

209
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,961
? High-tone places

210
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:26,507
ALEX:? Liz Taylor is not his style

211
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:29,385
ALEX:Was there a pet
in the house? Yeah, a pet.

212
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:33,889
ALEX:You know, like a dog or a budgie
or a gerbil or something?

213
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:40,896
ALEX:What I need here is "PC Plod saves Harry
the Hamster from house of horror".

214
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:46,277
ALEX:All right. Well, that's a pity.
You see, no pets - no human angle.

215
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:52,658
? My baby just cares for me

216
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:02,418
DOCTOR:- Hi, there. What happened to that guy?
JULIET:- What guy?

217
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:04,628
DOCTOR:That guy. The one that died.

218
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,505
JULIET:- Died?
DOCTOR:- That one last week.

219
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:09,383
JULIET:- Here?
DOCTOR:- Yes, here. Where else?

220
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:12,511
JULIET:Oh, him. Well, he died.

221
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:14,430
DOCTOR:That's what I thought.

222
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,602
Hello? Have you got room
for an overnighter?

223
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:31,405
? My baby don't care

224
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:34,700
? For cars and races

225
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,788
? Baby don't care for

226
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:41,916
? He don't care for high-tone places

227
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:47,505
? And Liz Taylor is not his style

228
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:51,592
- He's still here?
- Yeah, he couldn't get his car started.

229
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:53,969
When are you gonna let the police know?

230
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,264
You phone them if you want, David.

231
00:21:57,515 --> 00:22:02,895
LUMSDEN:- What about you?
LUMSDEN:- I'm getting used to having him around.

232
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:07,608
? With baby

233
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:11,362
? My baby just cares for

234
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:15,449
? My baby just cares for

235
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,664
? My baby just cares for me ?

236
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:27,002
LUMSDEN:What is it we do here, David?

237
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:29,004
DAVID:- Sorry?
LUMSDEN:- Here.

238
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:32,675
DAVID:- Right here?
LUMSDEN:- In this firm.

239
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:36,554
DAVID:- Well, it's a wide range of...
LUMSDEN:- Accounting, David.

240
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:41,726
DAVID:LUMSDEN:Chartered accounting is of ten sneered at.
Were you aware of that?

241
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:45,896
DAVID:- Not any real sneering as such, no.
LUMSDEN:- There's a whole wide world out there...

242
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,150
LUMSDEN:and it all needs to be
accounted for, does it not?

243
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,944
LUMSDEN:- Well, I...
LUMSDEN:- They sneer, do they not?

244
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:54,363
DAVID:- I'm not sure.
LUMSDEN:- It's unfashionable.

245
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:58,034
LUMSDEN:But yes, we're methodical,
yes, we're diligent, yes, we're serious.

246
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:01,829
LUMSDEN:And where's the crime in that?
Why not shout it from the rooftops?

247
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,542
LUMSDEN:Maybe sometimes we're a wee bit boring,
but, by God, we get the job done.

248
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:11,380
DAVID:- Yes, sir.
LUMSDEN:- That's why I think you fit in here.

249
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,800
DAVID:- I'm boring?
LUMSDEN:- You get the job done.

250
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:21,807
DAVID:- I see. I thought you meant...
LUMSDEN:- Which is why I trust you with this client.

251
00:23:51,754 --> 00:23:54,632
ALEX:Good morning. Can I help you?

252
00:23:54,882 --> 00:23:58,761
DAVID          (to Juliet):Yeah, I'll just check that for you.

253
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,119
JULIET:Let's do it.

254
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:27,123
ALEX          (VOICE-OVER):Let's talk about disposal.
We have to make that body unidentifiable.

255
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:30,668
ALEX          (VOICE-OVER):Burning, dumping at sea
and burial are all flawed...

256
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:34,672
ALEX          (VOICE-OVER):either by fingerprints or more commonly
by dental records, I have learnt.

257
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:37,550
ALEX          (VOICE-OVER):What I suggest is that
we bury him out in the forest.

258
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,137
ALEX          (VOICE-OVER):First we remove his hands
and his feet, which we incinerate.

259
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:45,266
ALEX          (VOICE-OVER):And his teeth, which we just
remove. It's as simple as that.

260
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:48,060
David.

261
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,690
ALEX          (CONTINUED):I've always wondered
what these were for. Now...

262
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:57,028
ALEX          (CONTINUED):This is what we need.

263
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,613
ALEX          (CONTINUED):And...

264
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:01,991
ALEX          (CONTINUED):This.

265
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:03,701
ALEX          (CONTINUED):- What else?
DAVID:- I don't know.

266
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,578
ALEX:A spade. We need a spade.

267
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:08,581
ALEX:I wish you'd concentrate.
We need a spade to dig a pit.

268
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:10,583
DAVID:- Who's gonna do it?
ALEX:- Dig the pit?

269
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,710
DAVID:ALEX:- Not that.
ALEX:- Who's gonna do what?

270
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,881
DAVID:- You know what I'm talking about.
ALEX:- Do I? What are you talking about?

271
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:20,217
DAVID:- You know what. Who's gonna do it?
ALEX:- We all are, David.

272
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:24,597
ALEX:We're all gonna do it. You, me and Juliet
will do his or her bit. Fair enough?

273
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:26,849
DAVID:- I can't do it.
ALEX:- I don't hear this.

274
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,269
DAVID:- I won't be able to do it.
ALEX:- You want out already?

275
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:33,522
ALEX:You don't want the money?
Hugo is going off! He smells!

276
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:40,321
ALEX:- The flat smells! We can't wait!
DAVID:- I won't be able to cut him up.

277
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:58,255
JULIET:- Who's going to do it?
ALEX:- I thought we all were.

278
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:01,550
JULIET:- I don't think I can.
ALEX:- But, Juliet, you're a doctor.

279
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:06,931
ALEX:- You kill people every day.
JULIET:- That's different. I still don't want to.

280
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:11,185
ALEX:Now you tell me.

281
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:34,291
DAVID:There's something I want to ask.

282
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:39,004
MAN:I don't know! I swear to God, I don't know!

283
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:42,800
ALEX:Family? Friends?

284
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,221
ALEX:Drugged-up, wandering, suicidal
fuck-ups don't have families.

285
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:52,268
DAVID:- I just thought we should discuss it.
ALEX:- Take his legs.

286
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:59,358
Where's Hugo?

287
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:52,203
Pick him up.

288
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:56,499
Pick him up.

289
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:02,671
I swear to God, I don't know! I don't know!

290
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:55,891
ANDY:Stupid fuckin' bastard.

291
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:06,610
ALEX:Why don't we draw lots for it?

292
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:11,115
ALEX          (CONTINUED):Whoever draws the short straw does it all.
That way you either do it or you don't.

293
00:29:11,365 --> 00:29:13,743
ALEX          (CONTINUED):- OK. I can go with that.
ALEX:- David?

294
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:17,663
DAVID:- I don't know.
ALEX:- If I draw the short straw, I'll do it.

295
00:29:17,913 --> 00:29:23,544
ALEX:But I'm not gonna do it
just because you won't.

296
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,753
ALEX:All right, then. Here we are and this is it.

297
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:10,257
ALEX:Do you wanna play or not?

298
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,964
DAVID:I can't do it.

299
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:34,884
DAVID:- Finished.
ALEX:- All right, but not quite.

300
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:37,887
DAVID:- Is that going to be deep enough?
ALEX:- Don't worry.

301
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:43,684
DAVID:- Is this necessary?
ALEX:- Yes. Now come on. All or nothin'.

302
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:34,068
JULIET:- Are you all right?
DAVID:- Oh, yes. I'm fine, thanks. Just fine.

303
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:38,531
JULIET:- Would you like to talk about it?
DAVID:- No.

304
00:32:57,133 --> 00:33:02,054
These three people
get their chance to...

305
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:06,308
lose a million.

306
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:30,416
JULIET:Yes, all right. Hello there and welcome
aboard our millionaire's yacht.

307
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:34,545
It's just like the "Marie Celeste"
but without the party atmosphere.

308
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:38,716
As you know, the object is not
to win the game, but to...

309
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:40,593
Lose.

310
00:33:40,843 --> 00:33:43,262
Not to give right answers, but...

311
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:46,557
- Wrong ones.
- Not to do well, but to do really...

312
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:48,893
Badly.

313
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:54,440
And above all to try
and make a total... hotchpotch.

314
00:34:02,114 --> 00:34:05,701
Be careful.

315
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:26,680
Alex!

316
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:35,981
ALEX          (to himself):I don't know why we couldn't
stuff it under the floorboards.

317
00:34:36,232 --> 00:34:42,071
- Stop nagging, Alex.
ALEX          (to himself):- We could have hid it in the fridge.

318
00:35:56,937 --> 00:36:01,942
MC:Ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention, please?

319
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,695
MC:I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight...

320
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:10,451
MC:to help us raise funds
for the sick children's unit.

321
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:13,746
ALEX:You never told me this was for children.
I hate children.

322
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:20,503
ALEX:ALEX:I'd raise money to have the little fuckers
put down. I want my money back!

323
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:22,880
MC:But before the dancing starts...

324
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,133
MC          (CONTINUED):- Excuse me!
MC          (CONTINUED):- .. I would like to give a vote of thanks...

325
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:32,431
MC          (CONTINUED):to the few people who have worked
so hard to make this occasion happen.

326
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:35,351
DAVID:- Do you know these people?
JULIET:- They're my friends.

327
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:39,855
ALEX:Oh, so if they want to speak to you,
we tell them that you're not here?

328
00:36:40,106 --> 00:36:47,363
MC:But ladies and gentlemen and those
of you who are neither or both...

329
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:53,160
MC          (CONTINUED):- Where did they dig him up?
MC          (CONTINUED):- Form sets for "Strip the Willow".

330
00:36:54,620 --> 00:37:00,292
JULIET:- Are we going to dance?
ALEX:- Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?

331
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:18,746
OK.

332
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:20,706
Talk to me.

333
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:22,708
Talk to me.

334
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:31,884
- OK.
- No! Don't! Please don't!

335
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:37,390
No! No!

336
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,227
Please!

337
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,869
DAVID:- Can we talk about something?
ALEX:- Not now. I have an idea.

338
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:05,167
DAVID:- It's important. We need to decide...
ALEX:- Will you just stop worrying?

339
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:09,630
ALEX          (CONTINUED):To love and to happiness for ever.

340
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,676
JULIET:For ever and ever.

341
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,473
ALEX:- What's wrong?
DAVID:- I want to talk now.

342
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,726
ALEX:When you've drunk
to love and happiness.

343
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:22,977
DAVID:- Now.
ALEX:- After.

344
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,646
JULIET:David, I promise we will.
Just keep him happy.

345
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:31,193
ALEX:It's not for me. It's for love
and happiness for ever.

346
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,993
ALEX          (CONTINUED):Look over there. It's Cameron.

347
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,037
JULIET:- Who?
ALEX:- You remember Cameron.

348
00:39:41,287 --> 00:39:42,747
JULIET:- No.
ALEX:- What's he doing here?

349
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:45,332
JULIET:- That's not him.
ALEX:- It is. Cameron!

350
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:49,712
ALEX:Cameron, come on over here. Come on.

351
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:53,382
CAMERON:What?

352
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:57,011
ALEX:Nothing. We thought
you were someone else.

353
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,555
ALEX          (CONTINUED):Good luck!

354
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:03,768
ALEX          (CONTINUED):- Why does he have to follow us around?
DAVID:- What I was wanting to say was this.

355
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,606
BRIAN:- The divine Juliet. Long time no see.
JULIET:- Brian.

356
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:11,776
BRIAN:- Would you care to dance?
DAVID:- Hold on. Who do you think you are?

357
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:13,861
BRIAN:- What?
DAVID:- Who do you think you are?

358
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:18,366
DAVID:- You interrupted us.
BRIAN:- I'm Brian Mckinley. And who are you?

359
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:24,080
DAVID:Well, Brian Mckinley, if you wanna talk
to my girlfriend, you talk to me first.

360
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,208
DAVID:If you wanna dance, you apply
three weeks in advance...

361
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,919
DAVID:or you're gonna end up
inside a fucking bin bag!

362
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:34,799
DAVID:You didn't apply, so you don't dance.

363
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:43,057
JULIET:Do you think you could be
a little more forceful next time?

364
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:47,520
DAVID:- I'm sorry.
JULIET:- No, no. I think he got the message.

365
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,772
DAVID:That was quite stressful.

366
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:54,360
ALEX:Yeah, but you were good. He was
really good. Fuckin' bin bag, I like that.

367
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,447
ALEX:You really explored
your maleness to the full there.

368
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:01,242
DAVID:- You think so?
JULIET:- You certainly had a good look around.

369
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:05,079
ALEX:You were magnificent.

370
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,998
Yeah.

371
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:11,836
Fuckin' bin bag.

372
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:38,070
Fuckin' bin bag.

373
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:46,579
ALEX:Cameron! What a surprise!

374
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:40,841
JULIET:Hello?

375
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:44,512
JULIET:Hello?

376
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:53,813
ALEX:- Who was it?
JULIET:- I don't know.

377
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:58,651
JULIET:- No one said anything.
JULIET:- Or rendered speechless with desire.

378
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:02,613
JULIET:I recall that feeling from
the days when I had such a thing.

379
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:06,867
JULIET:- Are you all right?
ALEX:- No.

380
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:12,581
JULIET:Then let's spend some money.

381
00:43:13,582 --> 00:43:17,878
ALEX:Hello. It's been a struggle,
but now our days of worry are over.

382
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:21,799
ALEX:The light at the end of the tunnel
has expanded into a golden sunrise.

383
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:29,265
ALEX:And now at last, at long last,
nothing will ever be the same again.

384
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:18,856
ALEX          (CONTINUED):This is Alex Law reporting on
the video diary of his own life.

385
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:21,650
ALEX          (CONTINUED):Let me tell you, I'm so happy I could die.

386
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,871
DAVID:I think we ought to stop this, don't you?

387
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:37,208
ALEX:- Oh, will you relax?
JULIET:- You're making us all nervous.

388
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:40,586
DAVID:- How much did you pay for this?
ALEX:- I don't know.

389
00:44:40,836 --> 00:44:43,047
- I can't remember.
DAVID:- Tell me how much you paid.

390
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:46,008
ALEX:- I can't remember.
DAVID:- How much did you pay for this?

391
00:44:46,258 --> 00:44:49,804
ALEX:- No idea. I don't know.
DAVID:- How much did you pay for this?!

392
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:53,974
- �500.
- �500?

393
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:57,520
You paid �500 for this?

394
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,190
JULIET:- That's what it cost.
DAVID:- No. That's what you paid for it.

395
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,821
DAVID:�500 is what you paid for it.
We don't know how much it cost us yet.

396
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:12,243
DAVID:For you two to have a good time.
We don't know the cost of that yet.

397
00:45:54,326 --> 00:45:58,456
DAVID:Excuse me. Did they take anything?

398
00:46:06,756 --> 00:46:08,758
ALEX:Is that enough for you?

399
00:46:09,008 --> 00:46:10,426
Oi.

400
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:12,845
ALEX:- What?
DAVID:ALEX:- Is that enough for you?

401
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:15,681
DAVID:- Yes, that's fine.
ALEX:- There's plenty more.

402
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:19,518
DAVID:That's fine.

403
00:46:24,732 --> 00:46:25,941
ALEX:- What's wrong?
DAVID:- Nothing.

404
00:46:26,192 --> 00:46:27,943
ALEX:- You're not eating.
DAVID:- Eating what?

405
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:34,784
ALEX:- You're not eating like you used to.
DAVID:- If you give me the plate, I'll eat.

406
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:51,258
ALEX:Now swallow.

407
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:58,474
ALEX          (CONTINUED):You should spend some money
instead of worrying about it.

408
00:46:58,724 --> 00:47:02,103
JULIET:- You'd feel much better.
ALEX:- Once it's spent, you don't have to worry.

409
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:05,898
JULIET:ALEX:- It'll be a weight off your shoulders.
ALEX:- You know we're right.

410
00:47:06,148 --> 00:47:09,652
DAVID:- I wanna secure it.
ALEX:- Secure it? You wanna put it in a bank?

411
00:47:09,902 --> 00:47:12,947
ALEX:You don't wanna put it in a bank, do you?
Do you want to bury it?

412
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:17,326
JULIET:ALEX:- I don't see the point. It's stupid.
ALEX:- Course it's stupid. We took the money.

413
00:47:17,576 --> 00:47:19,912
ALEX:It was a material calculation.

414
00:47:20,162 --> 00:47:24,041
ALEX:What's the point if it's underground
in some funny bank in some funny place?

415
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:27,628
ALEX:If you can't have it - spend it -
then what use is it? None.

416
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:32,383
ALEX:It's all for nothing. I didn't get into this
for nothing, so that I could have nothing.

417
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:37,054
DAVID:Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.

418
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:47,815
DAVID          (CONTINUED):Tastes different.

419
00:48:18,637 --> 00:48:23,017
ALEX:David, what are you doin' up there?

420
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:32,777
ALEX          (continued; calling from below):Will you come down now?
It's not safe up there.

421
00:48:42,244 --> 00:48:45,414
ALEX          (continued; calling from below):Are you listening to me?

422
00:48:45,664 --> 00:48:50,544
ALEX          (continued; calling from below):Security and insanity
are not the same thing.

423
00:48:53,923 --> 00:48:57,510
ALEX:Shit.

424
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:40,469
JULIET:I don't care. A grown man shouldn't
be living in a loft. He isn't safe up there.

425
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,224
JULIET:If you cared about him at all,
you'd use your influence to get him down.

426
00:49:45,474 --> 00:49:47,852
JULIET:- And the money?
- We could put it somewhere.

427
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:50,896
Where he can't get it?

428
00:49:51,147 --> 00:49:53,399
Well, you thought of that, not me.

429
00:49:53,649 --> 00:49:57,653
Forget it. He'll come down.

430
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:01,240
Oh, Juliet, look.

431
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,676
Hello, Mr Lumsden.
It's David Stevens here.

432
00:50:20,926 --> 00:50:23,846
I'm sorry, sir. I won't be able
to make it to the office today.

433
00:50:24,096 --> 00:50:29,101
DAVID:It's my mother, sir. She's very ill
and I think I need to be with her just now.

434
00:50:29,352 --> 00:50:33,522
DAVID:I don't know. The doctors aren't sure.
It could go either way.

435
00:50:33,773 --> 00:50:38,069
DAVID:Yes, sir. I'll certainly stay in touch.

436
00:51:11,185 --> 00:51:12,728
- Good day?
- What?

437
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:15,314
- Good day?
- What are you talking about?

438
00:51:15,564 --> 00:51:18,651
ALEX:- I'm just asking if you had a good day.
- Why?

439
00:51:18,901 --> 00:51:21,654
Well, I thought I'd make conversation.

440
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:26,117
ALEX:Please, I'd rather you didn't.

441
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:29,704
JULIET:- Are you expecting anyone?
JULIET:- No.

442
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:36,335
JULIET:- Aren't you going to answer it?
ALEX:- Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

443
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:43,402
ALEX:It's in the loft! In the loft!

444
00:55:56,679 --> 00:55:59,265
SALESMAN:September 19, London Heathrow
to Rio de Janeiro.

445
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:03,519
JULIET:SALESMAN:It's British Airways.
You're looking at �765. That's 7-6-5.

446
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:06,522
JULIET:- That sounds fine.
SALESMAN:- Air Portugal, on the other hand...

447
00:56:06,772 --> 00:56:12,611
SALESMAN:it's via Lisbon, the same day.
It's �565. 5-6-5. Is catering important?

448
00:56:12,862 --> 00:56:15,573
JULIET:- What?
SALESMAN:- Air France, Glasgow direct.

449
00:56:15,823 --> 00:56:19,410
SALESMAN:But then you're looking at
the wrong end of �912. That's 9-1-2.

450
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,872
JULIET:- The first one was fine. Heathrow direct.
SALESMAN:- It's up to you.

451
00:56:23,122 --> 00:56:28,085
SALESMAN:Air Patagonia, that's a new outfit.
Via... via lots of different places, really.

452
00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:34,425
SALESMAN:It's no catering. That's �411. 4-1-1.
It's good value, but refuelling at Bogot?...

453
00:56:34,675 --> 00:56:37,219
JULIET:The first one was fine.

454
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:42,016
SALESMAN:It's up to you. 7-6-5.
How will you be paying?

455
00:57:03,704 --> 00:57:08,042
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!

456
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,594
Oh, my God!

457
00:57:18,844 --> 00:57:20,805
Christ!

458
00:57:21,055 --> 00:57:25,935
ALEX:No, no. Dear God. No! Christ!

459
00:58:04,056 --> 00:58:06,684
ALEX:No, and that's it.
I refuse to discuss it any further.

460
00:58:06,934 --> 00:58:08,477
JULIET:- It's the only way.
ALEX:- I refuse.

461
00:58:08,728 --> 00:58:12,481
JULIET:- You're frightened.
ALEX:- I'm not frightened. I'm a little terrified.

462
00:58:12,732 --> 00:58:15,317
ALEX:Did you see what happened
to the last two people?

463
00:58:15,568 --> 00:58:18,154
ALEX:They went up alive and
they came back down dead.

464
00:58:18,404 --> 00:58:22,366
ALEX:Did you notice that? The difference,
I mean. Alive, dead - dead, alive.

465
00:58:22,616 --> 00:58:25,953
ALEX:It wasn't difficult to spot.

466
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,497
ALEX:He killed them both.

467
00:58:28,748 --> 00:58:33,085
ALEX:- He cut them up.
- Yeah, but you'll be all right.

468
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:38,674
- And how's that?
- Because you're smarter than he is.

469
00:58:40,509 --> 00:58:45,181
Yeah, well, that's what
I've always thought.

470
00:59:10,498 --> 00:59:14,585
MCCALL:Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector
McCall. This is DC Mitchell.

471
00:59:14,835 --> 00:59:16,879
MCCALL:I wonder if we could ask some questions.

472
00:59:17,129 --> 00:59:19,757
DAVID:- What about?
MCCALL:- It's about the burglary.

473
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:23,219
DAVID:- Burglary?
MCCALL:- Downstairs.

474
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:27,390
DAVID:- Of course.
MCCALL:- Can we come in?

475
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,476
DAVID:So I just heard
her cries for help and all that.

476
00:59:30,726 --> 00:59:33,604
DAVID:When I went downstairs,
there were other people there.

477
00:59:33,854 --> 00:59:37,733
DAVID:So I just stood around, you know,
waiting, the way people do.

478
00:59:37,983 --> 00:59:41,278
DAVID:And when your colleagues arrived,
I came back upstairs.

479
00:59:41,529 --> 00:59:46,117
DAVID:That's about all, I think. I didn't actually
see anything useful, I don't think.

480
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:48,953
MCCALL:And the other three people,
did they hear anything?

481
00:59:49,203 --> 00:59:53,708
DAVID:There are only two
other people in the flat.

482
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:04,552
MCCALL:- Two?
DAVID:- Who said there were four?

483
01:00:04,885 --> 01:00:09,140
MCCALL:We understood there were four people
living here. Not always, but now four.

484
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,226
DAVID:No, three. Who said there were four?

485
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:16,856
MCCALL:How strange. And how unsatisfactory
to have misleading information.

486
01:00:17,106 --> 01:00:19,400
MCCALL:Only three people here?

487
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,944
MCCALL:- You're sure?
DAVID:- Yes, absolutely.

488
01:00:22,194 --> 01:00:24,238
Who said there were four?

489
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:29,201
MCCALL:Make a note of that, Mitchell.
Only three rather than four. Write it down.

490
01:00:29,452 --> 01:00:32,204
MCCALL:You can use numbers or words.
I've no preference.

491
01:00:32,455 --> 01:00:35,416
MCCALL:- Which are you using?
MITCHELL:- Both, sir.

492
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:38,586
MCCALL:Excellent.

493
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:41,714
MCCALL:DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr Stevens.

494
01:00:41,964 --> 01:00:45,801
MCCALL:Under my tutelage, he will
undoubtedly make the grade.

495
01:00:46,052 --> 01:00:50,056
DAVID:- I see.
MCCALL:- I doubt it.

496
01:00:51,057 --> 01:00:53,059
MCCALL:- You'll wait in the hall?
JULIET:- I'll wait.

497
01:00:53,309 --> 01:00:57,563
ALEX:If it sounds like I'm getting killed,
call the police and tell them everything.

498
01:00:57,813 --> 01:01:00,524
ALEX:Except maybe that it was
his idea in the first place.

499
01:01:00,775 --> 01:01:03,027
ALEX:That's important.
I need to die misunderstood.

500
01:01:03,277 --> 01:01:04,820
JULIET:- Alex.
ALEX:- What?

501
01:01:05,071 --> 01:01:10,242
JULIET:As smart as you are,
you might need a little help.

502
01:01:11,827 --> 01:01:18,292
ALEX:David, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
open this lock and I'm gonna come up.

503
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:24,131
ALEX:But what's really important
is that you remain calm. OK?

504
01:02:09,885 --> 01:02:11,137
Alex?

505
01:02:11,387 --> 01:02:15,391
ALEX:It's all right. It's just a pigeon.

506
01:02:29,697 --> 01:02:33,743
ALEX:Well, he isn't up here.

507
01:02:37,246 --> 01:02:41,250
DAVID:Tell him to look for the money.

508
01:02:46,297 --> 01:02:48,007
JULIET:Look for the money.

509
01:02:48,257 --> 01:02:53,012
ALEX:Don't worry.
That's exactly what I'm doin'.

510
01:03:03,105 --> 01:03:07,360
JULIET:It's not up here. He has eaten it.

511
01:03:31,634 --> 01:03:34,637
DAVID:Are you looking for me?

512
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:36,931
ALEX:Looking for you, yeah.

513
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:40,893
DAVID:What for? What did you want?
The money? Was that it?

514
01:03:41,143 --> 01:03:43,270
ALEX:We just wanted to talk to you.

515
01:03:43,521 --> 01:03:49,110
DAVID:Who else have you just wanted to talk to?
Maybe you thought they'd already got me.

516
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,364
ALEX:- Who?
DAVID:- Your friends.

517
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:57,618
ALEX:I don't know what you're talkin' about.

518
01:03:57,868 --> 01:04:02,164
JULIET:He doesn't know, David.

519
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:07,086
DAVID:Maybe you don't.

520
01:04:07,336 --> 01:04:09,880
DAVID          (CONTINUED):I'm talking about the police.

521
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:42,885
NOTE In the following sequence, Juliet's face is not seen until:I thought you'd gone to work.

522
01:07:43,177 --> 01:07:46,972
JULIET:With a face like this?

523
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:07,034
OFFICE BOY:Alex, the editor wants to see you.

524
01:08:15,543 --> 01:08:20,172
JULIET:- I'm sorry.
JULIET:- So you should be.

525
01:08:22,925 --> 01:08:27,346
JULIET:Maybe we can still sort everything out.

526
01:08:31,642 --> 01:08:35,855
Well, we can certainly try.

527
01:08:38,232 --> 01:08:42,945
Three bodies. Decomposed.
Mutilated beyond recognition.

528
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:46,657
JULIET:- I don't know anythin' about it.
JULIET:- Of course you don't.

529
01:08:46,907 --> 01:08:50,453
JULIET:If you knew anything about it,
I wouldn't have to send you to cover it.

530
01:08:50,703 --> 01:08:54,331
- Cover it?
JULIET:- That's right. This is your break, son.

531
01:08:54,582 --> 01:08:57,168
Cover it?

532
01:08:59,587 --> 01:09:03,174
Jesus.

533
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:40,813
All right. The releasable and printworthy
facts of the day so far are as follows.

534
01:10:41,063 --> 01:10:45,359
JULIET:Late yesterday, forestry workers
came across one set of human remains...

535
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:48,446
in a grave which appeared
to have been recently dug.

536
01:10:48,696 --> 01:10:53,868
Further excavation revealed another
deeper grave with two sets of remains.

537
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:59,999
JULIET:- Is this a serial killer?
JULIET:- How come they haven't been identified?

538
01:11:00,249 --> 01:11:04,587
- Any obvious motive here?
JULIET:- Is it true that one has been skinned?

539
01:11:04,837 --> 01:11:07,089
Not entirely.

540
01:11:07,339 --> 01:11:10,801
All right, all right.
An area of skin "has" been removed.

541
01:11:11,052 --> 01:11:15,556
JULIET:And you'd better keep this to yourselves.
There's no hands, no feet, no teeth.

542
01:11:15,806 --> 01:11:18,684
JULIET:The face is totally
unrecognisable and, yes...

543
01:11:18,934 --> 01:11:23,356
JULIET:skin has been removed
from one of the bodies.

544
01:11:23,689 --> 01:11:25,858
As and when the corpses are removed...

545
01:11:26,108 --> 01:11:30,404
we will endeavour to ascertain the
mode of death and duration of burial...

546
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:35,409
as well as identification, which
will of course be passed on to you...

547
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:40,164
JULIET:after informing,
where possible, the next of kin.

548
01:12:27,002 --> 01:12:30,089
JULIET:- Are you OK?
- Yes, of course.

549
01:12:30,339 --> 01:12:34,343
Why wouldn't I be?

550
01:12:35,136 --> 01:12:41,058
ALEX:- I don't know. I just thought maybe...
ALEX:- We were just sorting things out.

551
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:44,687
ALEX:- You'd better read all about it.
- We already know.

552
01:12:44,937 --> 01:12:46,522
EDITOR:It was on the television.

553
01:12:46,772 --> 01:12:49,400
EDITOR:Of course, but print
provides a more lucid and...

554
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:51,694
Oh, shut up, Alex.

555
01:12:51,944 --> 01:12:56,032
EDITOR:It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't
deep enough and you wouldn't listen.

556
01:12:56,282 --> 01:12:58,284
EDITOR:It doesn't necessarily matter.

557
01:12:58,534 --> 01:13:02,788
EDITOR:They don't know who they are and have
nothing to connect us with them. Nothing.

558
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:05,332
EDITOR:I'm glad you're so certain, Alex.

559
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,835
EDITOR:It makes us feel a whole lot better.

560
01:13:08,085 --> 01:13:14,008
EDITOR:- I beg your pardon?
- It makes us feel a whole lot better.

561
01:13:14,592 --> 01:13:18,179
That's what I thought he said.

562
01:13:42,244 --> 01:13:44,163
Stop.

563
01:13:44,413 --> 01:13:46,624
What are you doin' here?

564
01:13:46,874 --> 01:13:48,834
EDITOR:It's about me and David.

565
01:13:49,085 --> 01:13:53,339
EDITOR:- The perfect couple, I should say.
EDITOR:- You mustn't take it so badly.

566
01:13:53,589 --> 01:13:58,135
Don't worry. I'd do exactly the same
thing, only I don't think I'm his type.

567
01:13:58,386 --> 01:14:03,015
EDITOR:- Don't you ever stop?
- No.

568
01:14:27,707 --> 01:14:31,043
EDITOR:Take all the time you like, Doctor.

569
01:14:31,293 --> 01:14:34,463
EDITOR:No, I've never seen any of them.

570
01:14:34,714 --> 01:14:38,300
Look again, if you like.

571
01:14:43,514 --> 01:14:46,058
ALEX:I'm sorry, I haven't seen them.

572
01:14:46,308 --> 01:14:49,854
- Do you have a good memory for faces?
- The same as everyone else.

573
01:14:50,104 --> 01:14:54,817
But in your work you must meet lots of
people every day. New people, new faces.

574
01:14:55,067 --> 01:14:56,527
Yes.

575
01:14:56,777 --> 01:14:59,321
What do you recognise most,
names or faces?

576
01:14:59,572 --> 01:15:02,616
Diseases.

577
01:15:02,867 --> 01:15:07,038
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

578
01:15:07,288 --> 01:15:12,043
- I suppose so.
- I meant, that's what it's like.

579
01:15:12,293 --> 01:15:14,670
- Sorry?
- You said you supposed so.

580
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,466
ALEX:- I wasn't offering it for debate.
- He wasn't offering it for debate.

581
01:15:18,716 --> 01:15:23,679
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

582
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:51,999
ALEX:No, I've never seen
any of these men before.

583
01:15:52,249 --> 01:15:55,920
Take a look at the first two.

584
01:15:58,172 --> 01:16:00,091
EDITOR:ALEX:No, I don't know them.

585
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:07,598
EDITOR:If I told you their car was parked outside
just now, would that surprise you?

586
01:16:10,726 --> 01:16:14,939
Yes, I suppose so.

587
01:16:17,149 --> 01:16:19,235
ALEX:Well, is it?

588
01:16:19,485 --> 01:16:22,655
- What?
- Parked there?

589
01:16:22,905 --> 01:16:25,408
No. Not any more.

590
01:16:25,658 --> 01:16:30,246
I just wondered if it would surprise you.

591
01:16:31,622 --> 01:16:33,290
- That's it.
- That's all?

592
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:35,376
Yes.

593
01:16:35,626 --> 01:16:41,215
ALEX:- Sorry to waste your time.
ALEX:- Oh, not at all. Don't worry.

594
01:16:42,007 --> 01:16:44,301
- One thing.
- Your watch.

595
01:16:44,552 --> 01:16:47,263
- Your watch.
ALEX:- Is it real?

596
01:16:47,513 --> 01:16:52,143
ALEX:Oh, no. It's a fake. I got it in Thailand.
The second hand doesn't sweep.

597
01:16:52,393 --> 01:16:55,980
- I see.
- Right.

598
01:16:56,022 --> 01:17:00,192
ALEX:Tell you what. If you do
remember these guys...

599
01:17:00,443 --> 01:17:04,321
ALEX:maybe you could give me
a phone on this number.

600
01:17:04,572 --> 01:17:08,701
Any time you like.

601
01:17:13,831 --> 01:17:18,252
I didn't tell them anything, nothing
at all, absolutely nothing. They're plods.

602
01:17:18,502 --> 01:17:23,591
ALEX:If they had any witnesses, any forensic
evidence, they would have whipped it out.

603
01:17:23,841 --> 01:17:27,219
- They know.
- They can know all they like.

604
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,638
- They know.
- So? They know.

605
01:17:29,889 --> 01:17:33,517
ALEX:So what? There's nothing
to connect us with that body stuff.

606
01:17:33,768 --> 01:17:38,731
- Except the money.
- He's right, Alex. They know.

607
01:20:19,934 --> 01:20:23,187
Come on.

608
01:20:23,437 --> 01:20:25,147
My office is closed.

609
01:20:25,398 --> 01:20:28,150
ALEX:Life, however, grinds on
towards its conclusion.

610
01:20:28,401 --> 01:20:33,447
In the meantime, you may wish to leave a
message, but the final decision is yours.

611
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:43,541
David? You forgot to wake me.

612
01:20:54,635 --> 01:20:59,056
- So let's go.
- You and me?

613
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:03,602
Together.

614
01:21:04,061 --> 01:21:09,734
ALEX:Hey! Alex! Who are you calling
at this time of night?

615
01:21:14,488 --> 01:21:18,075
ALEX:Come out here and talk to us.

616
01:21:33,299 --> 01:21:37,053
ALEX:Well? Sex lines, is that it?

617
01:21:37,303 --> 01:21:40,765
Triple-X-rated, interactive fantasies?
Old habits die hard.

618
01:21:41,015 --> 01:21:44,852
ALEX:- I was phoning your mother.
- You old devil.

619
01:21:45,102 --> 01:21:48,606
Well, anyway.
As you can see, we're leaving.

620
01:21:48,856 --> 01:21:51,817
ALEX:- So I gathered.
ALEX:- I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

621
01:21:52,068 --> 01:21:55,654
ALEX:- Don't worry. I'll forward your mail.
- No, really.

622
01:21:55,905 --> 01:22:00,493
DAVID:I am sorry. Sorry to be ducking out on
you. I hope you won't take it personally.

623
01:22:00,743 --> 01:22:04,121
No, no. Don't let it worry you.
It's probably for the best.

624
01:22:04,372 --> 01:22:10,002
All for the best. Exactly. I wouldn't
want things to end on a downer.

625
01:22:10,252 --> 01:22:13,172
- Not at all.
- I mean, we've ups and downs, right.

626
01:22:13,422 --> 01:22:16,509
Good times, bad times.

627
01:22:16,759 --> 01:22:19,261
We could talk all night,
but we have to go. Don't we?

628
01:22:19,512 --> 01:22:21,764
Yes.

629
01:22:22,014 --> 01:22:26,227
- And you need your sleep.
- Yes.

630
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:33,067
No, I can't think of
anything else that matters.

631
01:22:33,317 --> 01:22:36,195
- About your mail.
- Very good of you to offer, but...

632
01:22:36,445 --> 01:22:38,489
Where do you think you'll go?

633
01:22:38,739 --> 01:22:41,242
Where will we go?

634
01:22:41,492 --> 01:22:43,494
Where will we go?

635
01:22:43,744 --> 01:22:45,705
Juliet?

636
01:22:45,955 --> 01:22:48,624
- I don't know.
- Don't be so coy, dear.

637
01:22:48,874 --> 01:22:51,085
You're going to Rio.

638
01:22:51,335 --> 01:22:54,088
- What?
- That's right.

639
01:22:54,338 --> 01:22:56,799
Rio de Janeiro, on your own.

640
01:22:57,049 --> 01:23:02,596
You should know.
You bought the fucking ticket!

641
01:23:06,559 --> 01:23:09,270
Did you see that?

642
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,149
I bet she didn't show you that before
she sent you up there. What did she say?

643
01:23:13,399 --> 01:23:18,320
We'll split it together,
you and me, fifty-fifty.

644
01:23:20,031 --> 01:23:22,199
But I bet you didn't say you'd split on him.

645
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:25,661
- It wasn't like that.
- Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.

646
01:23:25,911 --> 01:23:29,498
I bought it.

647
01:23:29,915 --> 01:23:32,460
What?

648
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:35,629
I bought the tickets.
For her and for me. It was my idea.

649
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,215
Your idea. I see.

650
01:23:38,466 --> 01:23:40,301
Well, that fits.

651
01:23:40,551 --> 01:23:45,264
I mean, you and him fit together.
I should have seen that a long time ago.

652
01:23:45,514 --> 01:23:48,601
- Alex, stop him!
- No, let him go. Let him have it all.

653
01:23:48,851 --> 01:23:52,855
Juliet, let him go.

654
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:58,277
I'm leaving.

655
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:10,956
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):You shouldn't have hit her! Do what
you like, but you shouldn't have hit her!

656
01:24:26,263 --> 01:24:29,475
You want it?

657
01:24:29,725 --> 01:24:31,018
You want it?

658
01:24:31,268 --> 01:24:34,271
Aagh!

659
01:24:34,647 --> 01:24:38,651
You bastard!

660
01:26:28,094 --> 01:26:32,139
You did the right thing.

661
01:26:32,181 --> 01:26:36,102
But I can't take you with me.

662
01:27:48,049 --> 01:27:50,384
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):Be OK, Mummy.

663
01:27:50,634 --> 01:27:54,346
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):Oh, I'll be all right.

664
01:28:13,783 --> 01:28:17,370
Hello, Inspector.

665
01:28:41,894 --> 01:28:45,731
? It's the sound that lovers

666
01:28:45,981 --> 01:28:50,236
? Hear when they discover

667
01:28:50,486 --> 01:28:58,486
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):? There could be no other for their love

668
01:28:59,453 --> 01:29:05,668
? It's my happy heart you hear

669
01:29:05,918 --> 01:29:09,755
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):? Singing loud and singing clear

670
01:29:10,005 --> 01:29:14,218
? And it's all because you're near

671
01:29:14,468 --> 01:29:18,222
? Me, my love

672
01:29:18,472 --> 01:29:22,768
? Take my happy heart away

673
01:29:23,019 --> 01:29:26,939
? Let me love you night and day

674
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:31,318
? In your arms I wanna stay

675
01:29:31,569 --> 01:29:38,200
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):? Oh, my love ?

676
01:29:39,702 --> 01:29:43,080
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):Oh, yes. I believe in friends.

677
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:45,541
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):I believe we need them.

678
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:49,962
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):But, if one day you find that
you just can't trust them any more...

679
01:29:50,212 --> 01:29:52,465
well what then?

680
01:29:52,715 --> 01:29:56,302
What then?

681
01:29:58,179 --> 01:30:02,183
? Music fills my soul now

682
01:30:02,433 --> 01:30:06,437
? I've lost all control now

683
01:30:06,687 --> 01:30:10,066
? I'm not half, I'm whole now

684
01:30:10,316 --> 01:30:15,196
? With your love

685
01:30:15,446 --> 01:30:21,535
? It's my happy heart you hear

686
01:30:21,786 --> 01:30:25,831
? Singing loud and singing clear

687
01:30:26,082 --> 01:30:30,336
? And it's all because you're near

688
01:30:30,586 --> 01:30:34,340
? Me, my love

689
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:38,594
? Take my happy heart away

690
01:30:38,844 --> 01:30:42,890
? Let me love you night and day

691
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:47,103
UNIFORMED OFFICER          (CONTINUED):? In your arms I wanna stay

692
01:30:47,353 --> 01:30:52,983
? All night long ?
