1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,730
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

2
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,940
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,650
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,360
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udun!

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,730
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,590
No! No!

7
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,760
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,070
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,580
No!

10
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,610
Gandalf!

11
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,120
Gandalf!

12
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,030
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,430
Just a dream.

15
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,780
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,180
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,160
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,210
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,540
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,950
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,360
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,590
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,030
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,170
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,040
You never know.

27
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,440
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,080
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,340
It is special.

30
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,130
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,860
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,820
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,470
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,110
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,410
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,550
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,620
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,240
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,610
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,110
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,520
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,620
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,560
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,870
...but they did.

45
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,970
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,320
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,890
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,240
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,030
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,970
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,680
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,400
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,570
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,930
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,080
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,110
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,210
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,950
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,560
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,920
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,030
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,300
I can smell it.

63
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,010
We're not alone.

64
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,750
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,890
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,720
Where is it?

67
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,600
Where is it?

68
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,500
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,870
My precious.

70
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,010
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,280
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,100
This is Sting.

73
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,830
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,500
...haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,040
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,900
It burns!

77
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,370
It burns us!

78
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,310
It freezes!

79
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,380
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,210
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,890
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,650
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,420
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,300
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,030
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,870
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,220
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,220
Take it off us.

89
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,260
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,360
We swears.

91
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,100
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,540
We swears...

93
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,510
...to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,480
We will swear on...

95
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,620
...on the precious.

96
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,980
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,290
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,460
Yes...

99
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,520
...on the precious.

100
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,330
On the precious.

101
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,990
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,500
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,410
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,640
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,590
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,260
You've been there before?

107
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,860
Yes.

108
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,380
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,830
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,800
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,270
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,900
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:13,040
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,080
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,390
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,160
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,800
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,200
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,900
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,670
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,970
Follow me!

122
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,190
Merry!

123
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,650
Merry!

124
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,000
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,010
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,440
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,540
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,920
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,490
Merry!

130
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,990
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,330
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,430
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,140
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,010
Stop it!

135
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,850
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,080
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,060
You want some?

138
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,170
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,600
Merry.

140
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,000
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,240
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,940
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,450
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,880
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,180
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,460
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,970
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,200
Aragorn.

149
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,740
Let's move!

150
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,860
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,840
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,770
Hurry!

153
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,170
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,280
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,420
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,580
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,220
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

158
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,930
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,390
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,490
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,970
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,740
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,220
Rohan.

164
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,190
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,960
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,100
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,240
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,350
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,080
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,080
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,220
Saruman.

172
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,830
The world is changing.

173
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,600
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

174
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,040
...and Mordor?

175
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:44,350
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...

176
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,150
...and the union of the two towers?

177
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,630
Together, my Lord Sauron...

178
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,330
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.

179
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,650
The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.

180
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,490
The forests will fall.

181
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,260
A new order will rise.

182
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,240
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

183
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,360
...and the iron fists of the Orc.

184
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,090
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

185
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,890
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,090
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,390
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,400
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,040
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,810
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,810
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,970
Swear it.

193
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,230
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,330
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,030
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,640
Murderers!

197
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,670
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,640
Burn every village!

199
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,980
We have only to remove those
who oppose us.

200
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,050
It will begin in Rohan.

201
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,320
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

202
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,290
But no more.

203
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,730
Eothain! Eothain!

204
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,570
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,600
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,440
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,600
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,310
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,490
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,380
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,990
Quickly!

212
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,960
Go, child.

213
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,810
Rohan, my lord...

214
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,990
...is ready to fall.

215
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,760
Theodred.

216
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,600
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:44,050
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,790
My Lord Eomer, over here!

219
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,410
He's alive.

220
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,330
Theodred.

221
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,710
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,620
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,790
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,660
That is a lie.

225
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,740
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,400
Grima.

227
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,750
Grima.

228
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,810
Grima.

229
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,650
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,650
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,230
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:41,840
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,480
Can you not see?

234
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,710
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

235
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,410
...your warmongering.

236
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,590
Warmongering?

237
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,920
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,130
What was the promised price, Grima?

239
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,030
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,150
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,310
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,700
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

243
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,030
Too much.

244
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,170
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,140
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,910
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,550
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,920
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,250
It comes from the king.

250
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,520
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,760
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,690
Breathe.

253
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,640
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,850
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,020
...until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,530
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,160
Merry!

258
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,870
Merry!

259
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,770
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,420
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,460
It's the trees.

262
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,250
What?

263
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,430
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,090
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,800
...and come alive.

266
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,740
Alive?

267
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,300
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,780
...talk to each other...

269
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,810
...even move.

270
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,650
I'm starving.

271
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,880
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,520
Yeah!

273
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,990
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,560
What about them?

275
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,640
They're fresh.

276
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,070
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,020
What about their legs?

278
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,520
They don't need those.

279
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,150
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,860
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,160
Alive?

282
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,400
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,180
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,370
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,120
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,720
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,560
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,920
...a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,300
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,170
Pippin.

291
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,040
Let's go.

292
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,980
Go on.

293
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,650
Call for help.

294
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,120
Squeal.

295
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,490
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,140
Pippin!

297
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,890
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,340
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,400
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,280
...what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,410
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,470
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:53,480
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,190
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,990
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,090
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,710
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:26,240
This is Gimli, son of Gloin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,650
We are friends of Rohan
and of Theoden, your king.

310
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,120
Theoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,560
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,040
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

313
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,140
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,100
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,040
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,410
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,480
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,680
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:09,350
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,760
We are no spies.

321
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,860
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,500
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,770
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,100
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,240
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,570
We left none alive.

327
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,150
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,850
Dead?

329
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,560
I am sorry.

330
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,440
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,910
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,770
Farewell.

333
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,220
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,890
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,160
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
We ride north!

337
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,810
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,630
We failed them.

339
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,840
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,380
And the other.

341
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,760
They crawled.

342
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,030
Their hands were bound.

343
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,020
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,600
They ran over here.

345
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,440
They were followed.

346
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,380
The belt!

347
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,410
Run!

348
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,460
Tracks lead away from the battle...

349
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,430
...into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,770
Fangorn?

351
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,560
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,310
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,440
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,660
Come here!

355
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,740
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,820
He's gone.

357
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,240
Merry!

358
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:39,090
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,760
Run, Merry!

360
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,880
Little Orcs.

361
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,380
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,450
Tree?

363
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,610
I am no tree!

364
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,020
I am an Ent.

365
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,720
A tree-herder.

366
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,230
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,760
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,730
Don't encourage it!

369
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,170
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,310
And whose side are you on?

371
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,540
Side?

372
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,610
I am on nobody's side...

373
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,320
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,750
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,530
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,990
Hobbits?

377
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:55,100
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,800
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,170
They come with fire.

380
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,940
They come with axes.

381
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,950
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,950
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

383
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,990
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,990
Halflings!

385
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,290
Shire-folk!

386
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,800
Maybe you are...

387
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,730
...and maybe you aren't.

388
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,740
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,480
The White Wizard?

390
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,500
Saruman.

391
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,750
See? See?

392
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,360
We've led you out.

393
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,060
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,660
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,070
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,250
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,050
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:26,520
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,290
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,170
I found it. I did.

401
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:41,040
The way through the marshes.

402
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,740
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:49,010
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,650
Come quickly.

405
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,920
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,390
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,830
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,430
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,900
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,370
We are famished! Yes!

411
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,840
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,320
Here.

413
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,520
What does it eats?

414
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,670
Is it tasty?

415
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,570
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,510
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,240
We must starve!

418
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,790
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,820
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,830
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,800
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,270
Not like master.

423
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,730
Master cares.

424
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,780
Master knows.

425
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,210
Yes.

426
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,010
Precious.

427
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,220
Once it takes hold of us...

428
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,260
...it never lets go.

429
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,090
Don't touch me!

430
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,460
There are dead things!

431
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,400
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,200
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,480
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,310
A great battle long ago.

435
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,850
Dead Marshes.

436
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,790
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,220
This way.

438
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,160
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,770
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

440
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,070
...and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,790
Frodo!

442
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,950
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

443
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,990
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

444
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,020
Are you all right?

445
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,860
So bright.

446
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,860
So beautiful.

447
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,860
Our precious.

448
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,860
What did you say?

449
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,260
Master should be resting.

450
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,500
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,740
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,400
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,380
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:21,650
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

455
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,380
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:28,120
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

457
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:31,290
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,230
Were you?

459
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,670
Smeagol.

460
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,900
What did you call me?

461
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,010
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,950
A long time ago.

463
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,950
My name.

464
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,510
My name.

465
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,920
Smeagol.

466
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,660
Black Riders!

467
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,170
Hide! Hide!

468
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,050
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,850
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,290
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

471
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,400
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,650
Wraiths!

473
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,050
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,100
They are calling for it.

475
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,830
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,100
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,540
I'm here.

478
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,090
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:49,570
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,310
Orc blood.

481
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,090
These are strange tracks.

482
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,380
The air is so close in here.

483
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,960
This forest is old.

484
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,760
Very old.

485
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,800
Full of memory...

486
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,740
...and anger.

487
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,820
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,480
Gimli!

489
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,590
Lower your ax.

490
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,160
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,690
The Elves began it.

492
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:54,600
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,470
Talking trees.

494
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,130
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:04,540
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:20,930
The White Wizard approaches.

497
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,400
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

498
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,250
We must be quick.

499
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,460
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

500
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,470
Where are they?

501
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,200
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

502
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,640
They met someone they did not expect.

503
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,940
Does that comfort you?

504
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,080
Who are you?

505
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,520
Show yourself!

506
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,420
It cannot be.

507
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,360
Forgive me.

508
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,940
I mistook you for Saruman.

509
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,470
I am Saruman.

510
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,880
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

511
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,340
You fell.

512
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,350
Through fire...

513
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,820
...and water.

514
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:59,820
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

515
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,760
...I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.

516
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,310
Until at last I threw down
my enemy...

517
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,950
...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

518
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,520
Darkness took me...

519
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:40,360
...and I strayed out of thought
and time.

520
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,200
Stars wheeled overhead...

521
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,940
...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

522
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,210
But it was not the end.

523
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:56,290
I felt life in me again.

524
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,750
I've been sent back...

525
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,480
...until my task is done.

526
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,830
Gandalf.

527
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,490
Gandalf?

528
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,700
Yes.

529
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:14,270
That was what they used to call me.

530
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,400
Gandalf the Grey.

531
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,510
That was my name.

532
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,110
Gandalf.

533
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,140
I am Gandalf the White.

534
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:34,250
And I come back to you now...

535
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,920
...at the turn of the tide.

536
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,000
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

537
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:44,930
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

538
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,900
That is no short distance!

539
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,370
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

540
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,640
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

541
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,250
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

542
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,410
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

543
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,810
...in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested-?

544
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,590
I mean, charming...

545
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,490
...quite charming forest.

546
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:16,690
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

547
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:21,240
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

548
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:24,840
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

549
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,340
...that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

550
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,510
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

551
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,280
You still speak in riddles.

552
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:44,530
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

553
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,330
The Ents are going to wake up...

554
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:53,360
- ... and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

555
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,300
Oh, that's good.

556
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:58,170
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

557
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,510
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

558
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,340
In fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

559
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,250
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

560
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:32,940
That is one of the Mearas...

561
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,910
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

562
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,800
Shadowfax.

563
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,000
He is the lord of all horses...

564
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,540
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

565
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:24,390
O rowan mine

566
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,360
I saw you shine

567
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:32,060
Upon a summer's day

568
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,630
Upon your head
How golden-red

569
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:42,540
The crown you bore aloft

570
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,110
Such a beautiful verse.

571
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,190
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

572
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,620
You might call it far, perhaps.

573
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:58,330
My home lies deep in the forest...

574
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:02,430
...near the roots of the mountain.

575
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,430
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

576
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,630
And safe is where I'll keep you.

577
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,250
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

578
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:19,640
It's one of my own compositions.

579
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,010
Right.

580
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:27,320
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

581
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:32,360
And the dreams of trees unfold

582
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:38,990
When woodland halls are green and cool

583
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:43,270
And the wind is in the West

584
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,370
Come back to me

585
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:51,370
Come back to me

586
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:57,980
And say my land is best

587
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:09,100
Sleep, little Shirelings.

588
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,860
Heed no nightly noise.

589
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,940
Sleep till morning light.

590
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:22,740
I have business in the forest.

591
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,440
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

592
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:34,350
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

593
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:40,370
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

594
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:54,040
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

595
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,440
Sauron will suffer no rival.

596
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:02,150
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

597
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,760
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

598
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,760
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

599
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,490
The rumor has reached him.

600
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,630
The heir of Numenor still lives.

601
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,440
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

602
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,940
He fears what you may become.

603
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,610
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

604
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,410
He will use his puppet Saruman
to destroy Rohan.

605
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,080
War is coming.

606
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,810
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

607
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,420
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

608
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:42,290
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

609
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,560
His hold over King Theoden
is now very strong.

610
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:50,430
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

611
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,400
But for all their cunning...

612
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,130
...we have one advantage.

613
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,840
The Ring remains hidden.

614
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,850
And that we should seek to destroy it...

615
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,990
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

616
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,890
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

617
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,550
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

618
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:16,820
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

619
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,630
We must trust now in Frodo.

620
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,630
Everything depends upon speed...

621
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,800
...and the secrecy of his quest.

622
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,080
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

623
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:33,710
Frodo must finish this task alone.

624
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,780
He's not alone.

625
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,650
Sam went with him.

626
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,510
Did he?

627
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:45,320
Did he, indeed? Good.

628
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,360
Yes, very good.

629
01:02:56,370 --> 01:03:01,240
The Black Gate of Mordor.

630
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,540
Oh, save us.

631
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,550
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

632
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:22,250
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

633
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:25,870
So good Smeagol does,
master says so.

634
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,260
I did.

635
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:38,040
That's it, then.

636
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,880
We can't get past that.

637
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,430
Look!

638
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,060
The gate.

639
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:30,430
It's opening!

640
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,830
I can see a way down.

641
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,670
Sam, no!

642
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,210
Master!

643
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:13,600
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

644
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,540
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

645
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,810
- Now!
- No!

646
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,370
No! No, master!

647
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:25,540
They catch you! They catch you!

648
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,380
Don't take it to him.

649
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,050
He wants the precious.

650
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:38,250
Always he is looking for it.

651
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:42,330
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

652
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:46,470
But we mustn't let him have it.

653
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,970
No! There's another way.

654
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,810
More secret. A dark way.

655
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,780
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

656
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,340
He's up to something.

657
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,550
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

658
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,450
Yes. There's a path...

659
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:12,120
...and some stairs.

660
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:13,990
And then...

661
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:17,500
...a tunnel.

662
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,280
He's led us this far, Sam.

663
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:34,850
Mr. Frodo, no.

664
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,460
He's been true to his word.

665
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:43,520
No.

666
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,290
Lead the way, Smeagol.

667
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,840
Good Smeagol always helps.

668
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,830
Hello?

669
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,300
Treebeard?

670
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,340
Where has he gone?

671
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,950
I had the loveliest dream last night.

672
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,280
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

673
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:41,940
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

674
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,390
...you were sick.

675
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:48,820
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

676
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,270
Did you hear that?

677
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,810
There it is again.

678
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:08,340
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

679
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,050
You just said something... Treeish.

680
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:19,220
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

681
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,630
You're taller.

682
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,660
- Who?
- You!

683
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,460
- Than what?
- Than me!

684
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:35,100
I've always been taller than you.

685
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:39,900
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

686
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,270
Please, Merry.

687
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:46,280
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

688
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,690
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

689
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,090
3'8"!

690
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:57,860
Three-foot-eight.

691
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,830
You did something.

692
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,230
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

693
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,630
Merry!

694
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:15,140
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

695
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,220
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

696
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:21,550
Give me it back. Merry!

697
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,750
What's happening?!

698
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,090
It's got my leg!

699
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,920
Merry!

700
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,910
Help!

701
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,520
Away with you.

702
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:00,490
You should not be waking.

703
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,930
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

704
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:09,090
Go to sleep.

705
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,300
Away with you.

706
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:14,770
Come, the forest is waking up.

707
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:17,280
It isn't safe.

708
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,850
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

709
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:27,050
Anger festers in their hearts.

710
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:29,520
Black are their thoughts.

711
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:32,220
Strong is their hate.

712
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:35,160
They will harm you if they can.

713
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:38,890
There are too few of us now.

714
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:43,060
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

715
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,330
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

716
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:49,700
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

717
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:55,510
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

718
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:00,920
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

719
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:02,590
Oh, I'm sorry.

720
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,690
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

721
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:10,090
We lost them.

722
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:15,330
And now we cannot find them.

723
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:21,740
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

724
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:24,470
Can't say that I have.

725
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,040
You, Pip?

726
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,880
What do they look like?

727
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,990
I don't remember now.

728
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:58,310
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

729
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:01,710
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

730
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:05,320
...whose mind is overthrown.

731
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:09,750
Saruman's hold over King Theoden
is now very strong.

732
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:13,560
My lord, your son...

733
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,920
...he is dead.

734
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,230
My lord?

735
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,660
Uncle?

736
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,740
Will you not go to him?

737
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:36,250
Will you do nothing?

738
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,410
Be careful what you say.

739
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,750
Do not look for welcome here.

740
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:09,010
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

741
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:11,350
What a tragedy for the king...

742
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:14,520
...to lose his only son and heir.

743
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:20,150
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

744
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:25,230
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

745
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,870
Leave me alone, snake!

746
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,960
Oh, but you are alone.

747
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:36,370
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

748
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:39,980
...in the bitter watches of the night...

749
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:43,850
...when all your life seems to shrink.

750
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:48,220
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

751
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:52,950
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

752
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,100
So fair.

753
01:14:58,370 --> 01:14:59,730
So cold.

754
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,730
Like a morning of pale spring...

755
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,380
...still clinging to winter's chill.

756
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,610
Your words are poison.

757
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:58,650
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

758
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,840
I cannot allow you before Theoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

759
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,900
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

760
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,990
Your staff.

761
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,890
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

762
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,590
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

763
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,460
He's a herald of woe.

764
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:23,070
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

765
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:25,610
...Theoden King.

766
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:28,840
He's not welcome.

767
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:35,080
Why should I welcome you...

768
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:39,250
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

769
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:42,720
A just question, my liege.

770
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,760
Late is the hour...

771
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:49,890
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

772
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,760
Lathspell I name him.

773
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,840
Ill news is an ill guest.

774
01:18:56,010 --> 01:19:00,570
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

775
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:02,680
I have not passed
through fire and death...

776
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:06,080
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

777
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:09,180
His staff.

778
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:13,490
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

779
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:18,760
Theoden...

780
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,890
...son of Thengel...

781
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:26,040
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

782
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:32,270
I would stay still if I were you.

783
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,540
Hearken to me!

784
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,180
I release you...

785
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,320
...from the spell.

786
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:58,900
You have no power here...

787
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:02,700
...Gandalf the Grey.

788
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:13,180
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

789
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,120
Wait.

790
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,400
If I go, Theoden dies.

791
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,300
You did not kill me...

792
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:34,670
...you will not kill him.

793
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,270
Rohan is mine.

794
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,080
Be gone.

795
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,720
I know your face.

796
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,560
Eowyn.

797
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:39,130
Eowyn.

798
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:48,610
Gandalf?

799
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:52,020
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

800
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,990
Dark have been my dreams of late.

801
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:15,910
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

802
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,050
...if they grasped your sword.

803
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,150
I've only...

804
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:09,390
...ever served you, my lord.

805
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:14,560
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

806
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:17,500
Send me not from your sight.

807
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:22,540
No, my lord! No, my lord.

808
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,940
Let him go.

809
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:27,880
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

810
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:39,320
Get out of my way!

811
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,730
Hail, Theoden King!

812
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,880
Where is Theodred?

813
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,460
Where is my son?

814
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:46,380
Simbelmyne.

815
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:55,120
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

816
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:01,940
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

817
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,940
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

818
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:13,120
The young perish and the old linger.

819
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,810
That I should live...

820
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:19,350
...to see the last days of my house.

821
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:24,460
Theodred's death
was not of your making.

822
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,900
No parent should have to bury
their child.

823
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,480
He was strong in life.

824
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:54,150
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

825
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:40,670
They had no warning.

826
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,240
They were unarmed.

827
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:47,740
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

828
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,650
Rick, cot and tree.

829
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:53,180
Where is Mama?

830
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:58,180
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

831
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:02,760
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

832
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,350
Ride out and meet him head on.

833
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:11,590
Draw him away from your women
and children.

834
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:13,560
You must fight.

835
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:17,570
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

836
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:19,370
Eomer is loyal to you.

837
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:22,240
His men will return
and fight for their king.

838
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:26,320
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

839
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:32,220
Eomer cannot help us.

840
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,620
I know what it is you want of me...

841
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:38,060
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

842
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:41,430
I will not risk open war.

843
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:47,000
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

844
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,900
When last I looked...

845
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:56,970
...Theoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

846
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:06,120
Then what is the king's decision?

847
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,030
By order of the king...

848
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,670
...the city must empty.

849
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,700
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

850
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,910
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

851
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:24,600
Helm's Deep.

852
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:28,300
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

853
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,450
Who will defend them if not their king?

854
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:33,080
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

855
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:35,050
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

856
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:39,120
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.

857
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,490
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

858
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:43,820
What they will get is a massacre.

859
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:47,860
Theoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

860
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:52,070
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

861
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:55,400
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

862
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:58,670
The people of Rohan will need you.

863
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:01,510
The defenses have to hold.

864
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:04,680
They will hold.

865
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:10,990
The Grey Pilgrim.

866
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,790
That's what they used to call me.

867
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:19,060
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

868
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:22,860
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

869
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,700
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

870
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:30,270
At dawn, look to the east.

871
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,000
Go.

872
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:02,640
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

873
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:43,770
His name is Brego.

874
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,190
He was my cousin's horse.

875
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,220
Brego.

876
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:06,370
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

877
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:09,840
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

878
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,310
You speak as one of their own.

879
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:17,550
I was raised in Rivendell...

880
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:19,340
...for a time.

881
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,680
Turn this fellow free.

882
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:27,820
He's seen enough of war.

883
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:42,440
Gandalf the White.

884
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:44,980
Gandalf the Fool!

885
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:50,310
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

886
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:55,490
There were three
who followed the wizard.

887
01:32:55,890 --> 01:33:01,230
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

888
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,390
You stink of horse.

889
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:11,540
The Man...

890
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:17,770
- ... was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

891
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:21,750
One of the Dunedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

892
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,710
His cloth was poor.

893
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:29,750
And yet he bore a strange ring.

894
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:34,390
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

895
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:40,400
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

896
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:42,470
The Ring of Barahir.

897
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:47,030
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

898
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:50,540
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

899
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:53,440
The line was broken years ago.

900
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:56,340
It matters not.

901
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,040
The world of Men shall fall.

902
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:01,090
It will begin at Edoras.

903
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,230
I am ready, Gamling.

904
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,870
Bring my horse.

905
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,400
This is not a defeat.

906
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:23,040
We will return.

907
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,880
We will return.

908
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,210
You have some skill with a blade.

909
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,810
Women of this country learned long ago:

910
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:09,620
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

911
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:11,620
I fear neither death nor pain.

912
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:14,990
What do you fear, my lady?

913
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:20,200
A cage.

914
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:25,340
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

915
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:29,410
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

916
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:34,870
You're a daughter of kings...

917
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:39,450
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

918
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:47,250
I do not think that would be your fate.

919
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:23,360
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

920
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:25,630
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

921
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,700
He will expect an attack on the city.

922
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:33,270
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

923
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,780
...the great fortress of Rohan.

924
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:41,380
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

925
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:44,550
They will be slow.

926
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:49,360
They will have women and children
with them.

927
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:55,490
Send out your Warg-riders.

928
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,280
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

929
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:16,110
- Why do you do that?
- What?

930
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:18,810
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

931
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:21,280
Because.

932
01:37:22,830 --> 01:37:24,950
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

933
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:27,320
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

934
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,530
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

935
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,970
You have no idea what it did to him...

936
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:35,630
...what it's still doing to him.

937
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,940
I want to help him, Sam.

938
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:41,370
Why?

939
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:49,810
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

940
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:55,990
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

941
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,890
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

942
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:10,030
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

943
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,000
I do.

944
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,910
It's the Ring.

945
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,040
You can't take your eyes off it.

946
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,750
I've seen you.

947
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:25,050
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

948
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:29,050
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

949
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:31,920
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

950
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:35,030
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

951
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,930
Mine! My own!

952
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:39,900
Can't you hear yourself?

953
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:41,730
Don't you know who you sound like?

954
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:54,140
We wants it.

955
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,020
We needs it.

956
01:38:57,190 --> 01:39:01,990
Must have the precious.

957
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:05,600
They stole it from us.

958
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,130
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

959
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:13,200
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

960
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:16,640
No. Not master.

961
01:39:16,810 --> 01:39:20,640
Yes, precious. False.

962
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:25,310
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

963
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:28,920
Master's my friend.

964
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:34,150
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

965
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:37,920
Not listening. I'm not listening.

966
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:42,090
You're a liar and a thief.

967
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:44,290
No.

968
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:48,110
Murderer.

969
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:51,600
Go away.

970
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:54,140
Go away?

971
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:58,950
I hate you.

972
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,520
I hate you.

973
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:05,120
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

974
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:07,120
I saved us.

975
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:11,820
It was me. We survived because of me.

976
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:16,630
Not anymore.

977
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,530
What did you say?

978
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:25,440
Master looks after us now.

979
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:29,100
We don't need you.

980
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,370
What?

981
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:33,310
Leave now...

982
01:40:33,490 --> 01:40:37,290
...and never come back.

983
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:38,480
No.

984
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:43,190
Leave now and never come back.

985
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:51,700
Leave now and never come back!

986
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:06,380
We told him to go away.

987
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:09,520
And away he goes, precious.

988
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:11,680
Gone! Gone! Gone!

989
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:13,690
Smeagol is free!

990
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,050
Look.

991
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:24,730
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

992
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,680
They are young.

993
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:38,370
They are tender. They are nice.

994
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:42,080
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

995
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:46,380
You'll make him sick, you will...

996
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,790
...behaving like that.

997
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,960
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

998
01:41:59,170 --> 01:42:00,730
What's it doing?

999
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:04,100
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1000
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:06,470
It ruins it.

1001
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:10,280
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1002
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:16,980
What we need is a few good taters.

1003
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:20,920
What's taters, precious?

1004
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:22,820
What's taters? Eh?

1005
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,720
Po-ta-toes.

1006
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:28,300
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1007
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:35,300
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1008
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:38,510
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1009
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:41,040
Oh, yes, we could.

1010
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:44,710
Spoil a nice fish.

1011
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:48,620
Give it to us raw...

1012
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:51,820
...and wriggling.

1013
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:55,120
You keep nasty chips.

1014
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:58,120
You're hopeless.

1015
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:12,140
Mr. Frodo?

1016
01:43:30,030 --> 01:43:32,690
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1017
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:35,330
Servants of Sauron.

1018
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:38,330
They are called to Mordor.

1019
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:41,530
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1020
01:43:41,710 --> 01:43:44,870
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1021
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:50,110
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1022
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:55,450
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1023
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,780
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1024
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,190
Mr. Frodo.

1025
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:02,320
Look.

1026
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:08,270
It's an oliphaunt.

1027
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:19,470
No one at home will believe this.

1028
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:32,490
Smeagol?

1029
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:15,340
We've lingered here too long.

1030
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:19,670
Come on, Sam.

1031
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,850
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1032
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:42,660
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1033
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:45,730
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1034
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:50,470
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1035
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,700
The enemy?

1036
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:58,270
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1037
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,840
You wonder what his name is...

1038
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,620
...where he came from.

1039
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:11,030
And if he was really evil at heart.

1040
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:16,150
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1041
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:20,240
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1042
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:23,960
...in peace.

1043
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:30,640
War will make corpses of us all.

1044
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,760
Bind their hands.

1045
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:48,430
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1046
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:52,260
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1047
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,600
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1048
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:57,910
It's the beards.

1049
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:00,230
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1050
01:47:00,410 --> 01:47:03,280
...that there are no Dwarf women...

1051
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:07,710
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1052
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:11,250
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

1053
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,620
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1054
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:22,120
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1055
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:27,830
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1056
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:30,870
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1057
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,340
Cut down by Orcs.

1058
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:36,500
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1059
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:41,810
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1060
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:46,550
Doomed to wait upon an old man
who should have loved her as a father.

1061
01:47:56,530 --> 01:47:58,900
Gimli.

1062
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:01,130
No, I couldn't

1063
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,130
I really couldn't.

1064
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,270
I made some stew.

1065
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:12,710
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1066
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,580
Thank you.

1067
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:45,630
- It's good.
- Really?

1068
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:52,980
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1069
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:58,350
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1070
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:01,220
But he must be mistaken.

1071
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:05,900
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1072
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:10,230
Then you must be at least 60.

1073
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:13,890
Seventy?

1074
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,000
But you cannot be 80!

1075
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:20,710
Eighty-seven.

1076
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:25,910
You are one of the Dunedain.

1077
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:30,080
A descendant of Numenor,
blessed with long life.

1078
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:33,950
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1079
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:36,350
There are few of us left.

1080
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:39,360
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1081
01:49:40,130 --> 01:49:43,530
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1082
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:02,310
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

1083
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:06,540
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1084
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:10,760
Like my heart.

1085
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:14,890
Go to sleep.

1086
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:17,550
I am asleep.

1087
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:25,970
This is a dream.

1088
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:31,410
Then it is a good dream.

1089
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:45,520
Sleep.

1090
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:50,390
Arwen...

1091
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:41,700
Where is she?

1092
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:45,310
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1093
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:51,370
Our time here is ending.

1094
01:52:52,050 --> 01:52:54,610
Arwen's time is ending.

1095
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:56,610
Let her go.

1096
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:58,810
Let her take the ship into the west.

1097
01:52:58,990 --> 01:53:02,050
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1098
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:04,020
There it will be ever green.

1099
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:07,890
But never more than memory.

1100
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:12,190
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1101
01:53:12,370 --> 01:53:16,000
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1102
01:53:16,170 --> 01:53:18,470
She belongs with her people.

1103
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:08,620
Why are you saying this?

1104
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:13,380
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1105
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:17,490
It was a dream, Arwen.

1106
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:19,290
Nothing more.

1107
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:23,890
I don't believe you.

1108
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,710
This belongs to you.

1109
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:39,070
It was a gift.

1110
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,240
Keep it.

1111
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:46,950
My lord?

1112
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:54,320
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1113
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:19,250
What is it?

1114
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:22,810
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

1115
01:55:39,370 --> 01:55:41,430
Wargs!

1116
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:55,650
A scout!

1117
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:04,490
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1118
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:08,030
Get them out of here!

1119
01:56:12,770 --> 01:56:14,800
All riders to the head of the column.

1120
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:17,500
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1121
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,400
Come on!

1122
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:33,660
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1123
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:35,320
- I can fight.
- No!

1124
01:56:38,030 --> 01:56:40,090
You must do this, for me.

1125
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:43,690
Follow me!

1126
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:51,500
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1127
01:56:51,710 --> 01:56:54,370
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1128
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,880
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1129
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:13,240
That one counts as mine!

1130
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:31,560
Stinking creature.

1131
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:00,720
Aragorn!

1132
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:06,890
Aragorn?

1133
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,810
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1134
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:25,410
He's...

1135
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:27,570
...dead.

1136
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:31,110
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1137
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,020
You lie.

1138
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:11,550
Get the wounded on horses.

1139
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:16,020
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1140
02:01:16,430 --> 02:01:18,550
Leave the dead.

1141
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:27,460
Come.

1142
02:01:37,650 --> 02:01:39,240
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1143
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:42,320
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1144
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:46,690
We're safe!

1145
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:51,060
We're safe, my lady.

1146
02:01:51,230 --> 02:01:52,420
Thank you.

1147
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:38,170
- Mama!
- Eothain!

1148
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:39,900
Freda!

1149
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:48,480
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1150
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:53,650
Take it to the caves.

1151
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:56,650
Make way for the king.

1152
02:02:57,690 --> 02:03:01,490
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.

1153
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:13,130
So few. So few of you have returned.

1154
02:03:15,910 --> 02:03:18,170
Our people are safe.

1155
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:22,070
We have paid for it with many lives.

1156
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:24,440
My lady.

1157
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:30,420
Lord Aragorn...

1158
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:31,820
...where is he?

1159
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:35,350
He fell.

1160
02:03:58,050 --> 02:04:01,020
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1161
02:04:01,190 --> 02:04:04,120
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1162
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:07,450
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

1163
02:04:07,620 --> 02:04:10,220
Get them into the caves.

1164
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:15,960
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1165
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,400
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

1166
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:23,900
Its outer wall is solid rock...

1167
02:04:24,070 --> 02:04:27,170
...but for a small culvert
at its base...

1168
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:30,110
...which is little more than a drain.

1169
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:37,110
How? How can fire undo stone?

1170
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:41,850
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1171
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:49,450
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1172
02:04:49,630 --> 02:04:53,160
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1173
02:04:53,330 --> 02:04:55,900
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

1174
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:57,500
Tens of thousands.

1175
02:04:57,670 --> 02:05:01,730
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1176
02:05:13,650 --> 02:05:16,750
A new power is rising.

1177
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:19,920
Its victory is at hand.

1178
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:27,660
This night...

1179
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:32,430
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1180
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:35,940
March to Helm's Deep!

1181
02:05:36,110 --> 02:05:39,600
Leave none alive!

1182
02:05:42,110 --> 02:05:44,600
To war!

1183
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:52,980
There will be no dawn for Men.

1184
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:12,230
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1185
02:06:12,410 --> 02:06:15,570
There is always smoke rising...

1186
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:19,610
...from Isengard these days.

1187
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:21,440
Isengard?

1188
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:23,520
There was a time...

1189
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:27,380
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1190
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:30,920
But now he has a mind of metal...

1191
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:34,030
...and wheels.

1192
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:39,290
He no longer cares for growing things.

1193
02:06:39,470 --> 02:06:41,270
What is it?

1194
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:48,470
It's Saruman's army.

1195
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:50,200
The war has started.

1196
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:32,880
May the grace of the Valar
protect you.

1197
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:07,050
Brego.

1198
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:34,340
Arwen.

1199
02:08:44,190 --> 02:08:45,990
I have made my choice.

1200
02:08:52,430 --> 02:08:55,300
He is not coming back.

1201
02:08:56,730 --> 02:09:00,070
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1202
02:09:00,970 --> 02:09:03,960
There is still hope.

1203
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:11,880
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1204
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:18,250
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

1205
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:20,910
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

1206
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:25,790
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1207
02:09:26,060 --> 02:09:29,050
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1208
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:32,170
...Aragorn will die.

1209
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,560
And there will be no comfort
for you...

1210
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:41,970
...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

1211
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:47,510
He will come to death...

1212
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:50,280
...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...

1213
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:55,120
...in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1214
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:08,160
But you, my daughter...

1215
02:10:08,970 --> 02:10:14,000
...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...

1216
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:18,240
...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

1217
02:10:20,650 --> 02:10:23,050
Here you will dwell...

1218
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:28,120
...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...

1219
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:31,850
...until all the world is changed...

1220
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:36,520
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1221
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:46,230
Arwen.

1222
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:55,140
There is nothing for you here...

1223
02:10:55,810 --> 02:10:57,910
...only death.

1224
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:34,970
The power of the enemy is growing.

1225
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:37,770
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...

1226
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:41,380
...to destroy the people of Rohan.

1227
02:12:43,450 --> 02:12:47,080
Isengard has been unleashed.

1228
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:54,760
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...

1229
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:58,890
...the last free kingdom of Men.

1230
02:12:59,060 --> 02:13:03,470
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

1231
02:13:07,170 --> 02:13:10,270
He senses the Ring is close.

1232
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:13,900
The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.

1233
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:18,140
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...

1234
02:13:19,690 --> 02:13:23,550
...the quest will claim his life.

1235
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:25,880
You know this.

1236
02:13:26,490 --> 02:13:29,320
You have foreseen it.

1237
02:13:31,430 --> 02:13:34,890
It is the risk we all took.

1238
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:43,470
In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.

1239
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:49,080
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.

1240
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:54,710
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

1241
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:58,480
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

1242
02:13:58,660 --> 02:14:02,750
...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

1243
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,990
It is close now.

1244
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:11,430
So close to achieving its goal.

1245
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:18,170
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

1246
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:22,470
...even unto to the ending
of the world.

1247
02:14:24,310 --> 02:14:26,140
The time of the Elves...

1248
02:14:26,350 --> 02:14:28,280
...is over.

1249
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:32,710
Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?

1250
02:14:34,660 --> 02:14:37,920
Do we let them stand alone?

1251
02:14:42,530 --> 02:14:43,900
What news?

1252
02:14:44,070 --> 02:14:46,860
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1253
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:49,900
Theoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1254
02:14:50,070 --> 02:14:54,100
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1255
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:56,680
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1256
02:14:57,010 --> 02:14:59,140
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1257
02:14:59,310 --> 02:15:02,710
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1258
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:07,380
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1259
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:10,610
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1260
02:15:12,730 --> 02:15:14,920
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1261
02:15:15,090 --> 02:15:17,790
Sauron from Mordor.

1262
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:22,330
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1263
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:24,200
Gondor is weak.

1264
02:15:24,370 --> 02:15:27,500
Sauron will strike us soon.

1265
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:30,110
And he will strike hard.

1266
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:34,640
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1267
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:50,790
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1268
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:53,690
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1269
02:15:53,870 --> 02:15:56,130
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1270
02:16:03,010 --> 02:16:04,730
Speak.

1271
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:08,440
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1272
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:11,810
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1273
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:13,740
Your bodyguard?

1274
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:15,710
His gardener.

1275
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:18,310
And where is your skulking friend?

1276
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:22,120
That gangrel creature.

1277
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:24,430
He had an ill-favored look.

1278
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:28,060
There was no other.

1279
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:34,500
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1280
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:40,900
One we lost in Moria...

1281
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:43,500
...two were my kin...

1282
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:47,410
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1283
02:16:47,580 --> 02:16:51,490
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1284
02:16:56,490 --> 02:16:58,250
You're a friend of Boromir?

1285
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:02,190
Yes.

1286
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:04,360
For my part.

1287
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:13,810
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1288
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:17,310
Dead?

1289
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:19,540
How? When?

1290
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:22,440
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1291
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:26,580
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1292
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:35,790
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1293
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,090
It was cloven in two.

1294
02:17:40,770 --> 02:17:44,170
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1295
02:17:46,210 --> 02:17:48,000
He was my brother.

1296
02:18:36,890 --> 02:18:39,910
Boromir!

1297
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:42,320
Boromir!

1298
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:50,330
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1299
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:54,160
A place of light and beauty and music.

1300
02:18:54,340 --> 02:18:56,670
And so it shall be once more!

1301
02:18:59,210 --> 02:19:01,870
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1302
02:19:02,050 --> 02:19:06,410
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1303
02:19:10,220 --> 02:19:15,880
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1304
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:18,230
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1305
02:19:18,390 --> 02:19:21,230
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1306
02:19:29,940 --> 02:19:32,700
Good speech. Nice and short.

1307
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:35,770
Leaves more time for drinking!

1308
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:40,340
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1309
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:45,950
Remember today, little brother.

1310
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:49,110
Today, life is good.

1311
02:19:53,290 --> 02:19:54,880
What?

1312
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:56,730
He's here.

1313
02:19:59,930 --> 02:20:01,770
One moment of peace,
can he not give us that?

1314
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:02,960
Where is he?

1315
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:06,590
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1316
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:08,870
Father!

1317
02:20:13,710 --> 02:20:16,080
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1318
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:19,650
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1319
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:24,020
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1320
02:20:24,820 --> 02:20:27,120
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1321
02:20:27,290 --> 02:20:29,320
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1322
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:31,190
Oh, too few.

1323
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:34,100
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1324
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:39,360
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1325
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:41,800
That is not my intent.

1326
02:20:41,970 --> 02:20:45,740
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1327
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:52,010
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1328
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:54,950
...I know his uses, and they are few.

1329
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:58,710
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1330
02:20:59,890 --> 02:21:02,320
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1331
02:21:02,490 --> 02:21:05,360
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1332
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:09,330
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1333
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:13,830
The One Ring.

1334
02:21:16,570 --> 02:21:21,240
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1335
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:25,040
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1336
02:21:25,210 --> 02:21:29,340
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1337
02:21:31,150 --> 02:21:33,820
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1338
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:37,690
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1339
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:41,820
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1340
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:47,300
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1341
02:21:47,470 --> 02:21:52,530
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1342
02:21:52,710 --> 02:21:54,200
He will return.

1343
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:58,110
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1344
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:00,840
You must go.

1345
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:04,110
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1346
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:10,450
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1347
02:22:10,620 --> 02:22:14,320
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1348
02:22:14,490 --> 02:22:17,460
- ... send me in his stead.
- You?

1349
02:22:18,630 --> 02:22:20,570
Oh, I see.

1350
02:22:20,730 --> 02:22:24,930
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1351
02:22:25,370 --> 02:22:27,360
I think not.

1352
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:30,410
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1353
02:22:30,580 --> 02:22:33,480
The one who will not fail me.

1354
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:53,790
Remember today, little brother.

1355
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:14,140
Captain Faramir!

1356
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:17,550
We found the third one.

1357
02:23:29,030 --> 02:23:31,020
You must come with me. Now.

1358
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:43,370
Down there.

1359
02:23:58,300 --> 02:24:01,160
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1360
02:24:11,770 --> 02:24:13,260
They wait for my command.

1361
02:24:18,750 --> 02:24:19,840
Shall I shoot?

1362
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:24,110
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

1363
02:24:24,290 --> 02:24:26,120
So juicy sweet

1364
02:24:26,750 --> 02:24:29,720
Our only wish
To catch a fish

1365
02:24:29,890 --> 02:24:32,590
So juicy sweet

1366
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:41,000
Wait.

1367
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:45,340
This creature is bound to me.

1368
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:47,870
And I to him.

1369
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:52,440
He is our guide.

1370
02:24:57,180 --> 02:24:58,580
Please...

1371
02:24:58,750 --> 02:25:00,620
...let me go down to him.

1372
02:25:11,900 --> 02:25:13,560
Smeagol.

1373
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:16,800
Master is here.

1374
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,130
Come, Smeagol.

1375
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:24,630
Trust master. Come.

1376
02:25:27,810 --> 02:25:31,650
We must go now?

1377
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:35,450
Smeagol, you must trust master.

1378
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:37,020
Follow me. Come on.

1379
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:39,810
Come.

1380
02:25:42,330 --> 02:25:43,520
Come, Smeagol.

1381
02:25:44,030 --> 02:25:46,090
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

1382
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:48,120
Come on.

1383
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:54,200
Don't hurt him!

1384
02:25:54,370 --> 02:25:57,100
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.

1385
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:58,570
Master!

1386
02:26:23,770 --> 02:26:26,130
That's enough.

1387
02:26:29,770 --> 02:26:31,930
Where are you leading them?

1388
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:35,400
Answer me.

1389
02:26:36,210 --> 02:26:39,440
Smeagol.

1390
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:47,650
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

1391
02:26:48,890 --> 02:26:51,520
Cruel Men hurts us.

1392
02:26:51,690 --> 02:26:54,690
Master tricksed us.

1393
02:26:54,860 --> 02:26:58,420
Of course he did.

1394
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:02,500
I told you he was tricksy.

1395
02:27:02,670 --> 02:27:05,700
I told you he was false.

1396
02:27:05,870 --> 02:27:08,570
Master is our friend.

1397
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:11,110
Our friend.

1398
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:13,440
Master betrayed us.

1399
02:27:13,610 --> 02:27:16,610
No. Not its business.

1400
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:20,120
Leave us alone!

1401
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:22,690
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1402
02:27:22,860 --> 02:27:25,150
They stole it from us!

1403
02:27:25,330 --> 02:27:26,760
No. No.

1404
02:27:27,330 --> 02:27:28,950
What did they steal?

1405
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:36,430
My precious!

1406
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:41,770
We have to get out of here.

1407
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:44,340
You go. Go, now.

1408
02:27:46,940 --> 02:27:48,810
You can do it.

1409
02:27:50,250 --> 02:27:51,720
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1410
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:53,680
Just this once.

1411
02:27:53,850 --> 02:27:55,620
Put it on.

1412
02:27:56,050 --> 02:27:58,080
Disappear.

1413
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:00,210
I can't.

1414
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:05,530
You were right, Sam.

1415
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:09,460
You tried to tell me but...

1416
02:28:14,170 --> 02:28:16,330
I'm sorry.

1417
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:23,750
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1418
02:28:25,150 --> 02:28:26,810
If I put it on...

1419
02:28:26,980 --> 02:28:29,320
...he'll find me.

1420
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:32,960
He'll see.

1421
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:36,160
Mr. Frodo...

1422
02:28:41,100 --> 02:28:45,360
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1423
02:28:47,570 --> 02:28:50,560
Here in the Wild I have you...

1424
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:52,640
...two Halflings...

1425
02:28:52,810 --> 02:28:55,970
...and a host of men at my call.

1426
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:02,770
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1427
02:29:12,460 --> 02:29:16,190
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1428
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:20,830
...to show his quality.

1429
02:29:41,950 --> 02:29:43,550
No!

1430
02:29:46,730 --> 02:29:48,060
Stop it!

1431
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:49,290
Leave him alone.

1432
02:29:50,630 --> 02:29:53,120
Don't you understand?

1433
02:29:54,430 --> 02:29:56,330
He's got to destroy it!

1434
02:29:56,500 --> 02:29:59,730
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1435
02:29:59,910 --> 02:30:01,570
To the Mountain of Fire!

1436
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:05,740
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1437
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:08,900
Please. It's such a burden.

1438
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:13,180
Will you not help him?

1439
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:16,420
Captain?

1440
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:19,320
Prepare to leave.

1441
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:26,700
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1442
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:42,330
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1443
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:45,560
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1444
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:49,510
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1445
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:53,700
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1446
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:55,870
Bless you, laddie.

1447
02:31:56,450 --> 02:31:58,180
Gimli, where is the king?

1448
02:32:11,970 --> 02:32:13,300
You look terrible.

1449
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,100
A great host, you say?

1450
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:59,940
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1451
02:33:00,610 --> 02:33:03,600
Ten thousand strong at least.

1452
02:33:05,150 --> 02:33:06,580
Ten thousand?

1453
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:09,510
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1454
02:33:12,190 --> 02:33:14,320
To destroy the world of Men.

1455
02:33:16,830 --> 02:33:18,820
They will be here by nightfall.

1456
02:33:24,670 --> 02:33:25,970
Let them come!

1457
02:33:27,470 --> 02:33:30,230
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1458
02:33:30,410 --> 02:33:33,540
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1459
02:33:41,790 --> 02:33:44,720
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1460
02:33:44,890 --> 02:33:47,320
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1461
02:33:47,490 --> 02:33:50,220
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1462
02:33:50,390 --> 02:33:52,790
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1463
02:33:53,400 --> 02:33:55,590
These are Uruk-hai.

1464
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:59,200
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1465
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:04,500
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1466
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:08,270
I know how to defend my own keep.

1467
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:18,280
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1468
02:34:18,450 --> 02:34:23,690
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1469
02:34:23,890 --> 02:34:26,550
Crops can be resown...

1470
02:34:26,730 --> 02:34:29,720
...homes rebuilt.

1471
02:34:30,330 --> 02:34:32,890
Within these walls...

1472
02:34:33,270 --> 02:34:34,760
...we will outlast them.

1473
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:37,340
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1474
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:39,060
They come to destroy its people...

1475
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:41,730
...down to the last child.

1476
02:34:42,610 --> 02:34:44,870
What would you have me do?

1477
02:34:45,050 --> 02:34:46,770
Look at my men.

1478
02:34:46,950 --> 02:34:48,670
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1479
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:55,290
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1480
02:34:55,450 --> 02:34:58,480
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1481
02:35:02,130 --> 02:35:04,030
Send out riders, my lord.

1482
02:35:04,330 --> 02:35:07,200
You must call for aid.

1483
02:35:10,470 --> 02:35:12,730
And who will come?

1484
02:35:13,140 --> 02:35:14,730
Elves?

1485
02:35:14,910 --> 02:35:16,970
Dwarves?

1486
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:20,610
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1487
02:35:21,450 --> 02:35:23,710
The old alliances are dead.

1488
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:26,950
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1489
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:29,310
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1490
02:35:30,290 --> 02:35:33,520
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1491
02:35:33,690 --> 02:35:35,630
Where was Gon-?

1492
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:40,230
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1493
02:35:41,830 --> 02:35:44,300
...we are alone.

1494
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:52,900
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1495
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:54,340
We need more time
to lay provisions-

1496
02:35:54,510 --> 02:35:58,000
There is no time. War is upon us.

1497
02:35:58,280 --> 02:35:59,980
Secure the gate.

1498
02:36:05,190 --> 02:36:07,280
We Ents have not troubled...

1499
02:36:07,490 --> 02:36:10,860
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1500
02:36:11,630 --> 02:36:14,600
...for a very long time.

1501
02:36:15,860 --> 02:36:20,630
But now, something
is about to happen...

1502
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:23,130
...that has not happened...

1503
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:25,810
...for an age.

1504
02:36:27,010 --> 02:36:29,270
Entmoot.

1505
02:36:29,710 --> 02:36:30,700
What's that?

1506
02:36:31,110 --> 02:36:33,950
'Tis a gathering.

1507
02:36:35,150 --> 02:36:37,710
A gathering of what?

1508
02:36:55,640 --> 02:36:58,000
Beech. Oak.

1509
02:36:58,170 --> 02:37:00,070
Chestnut. Ash.

1510
02:37:00,340 --> 02:37:02,310
Good. Good. Good.

1511
02:37:02,480 --> 02:37:04,840
Many have come.

1512
02:37:12,390 --> 02:37:15,150
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1513
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:17,880
...will go to war.

1514
02:37:26,830 --> 02:37:29,890
Move back! Move to the caves!

1515
02:37:32,370 --> 02:37:34,430
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1516
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:37,140
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1517
02:37:37,310 --> 02:37:39,610
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1518
02:37:39,780 --> 02:37:42,910
Aragorn, you must rest.

1519
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:45,480
You're no use to us half alive.

1520
02:37:45,950 --> 02:37:47,150
Aragorn!

1521
02:37:50,560 --> 02:37:53,580
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1522
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:55,420
That is an honorable charge.

1523
02:37:55,590 --> 02:37:58,460
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1524
02:37:58,630 --> 02:38:00,330
What renown is there in that?

1525
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:04,200
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1526
02:38:04,470 --> 02:38:07,270
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1527
02:38:07,440 --> 02:38:12,430
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1528
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:15,540
You do not command
the others to stay!

1529
02:38:15,710 --> 02:38:19,480
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1530
02:38:20,650 --> 02:38:22,850
Because they love you.

1531
02:38:29,960 --> 02:38:31,480
I'm sorry.

1532
02:39:37,390 --> 02:39:40,690
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1533
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:43,560
These are no soldiers.

1534
02:39:45,830 --> 02:39:49,290
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1535
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:56,140
Look at them. They're frightened.

1536
02:39:56,310 --> 02:39:57,780
I can see it in their eyes.

1537
02:40:18,730 --> 02:40:20,930
Then I shall die as one of them!

1538
02:40:27,370 --> 02:40:29,200
Let him go, lad.

1539
02:40:29,770 --> 02:40:31,740
Let him be.

1540
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:38,670
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1541
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:44,850
My lord?

1542
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:49,490
Who am I, Gamling?

1543
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:56,770
You are our king, sire.

1544
02:40:59,770 --> 02:41:03,040
And do you trust your king?

1545
02:41:04,570 --> 02:41:07,740
Your men, my lord...

1546
02:41:07,910 --> 02:41:10,710
...will follow you to whatever end.

1547
02:41:17,590 --> 02:41:19,490
To whatever end.

1548
02:41:29,330 --> 02:41:32,890
Where is the horse and the rider?

1549
02:41:33,070 --> 02:41:36,130
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1550
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:42,080
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1551
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:46,310
Like wind in the meadow.

1552
02:41:49,980 --> 02:41:53,750
The days have gone down in the West...

1553
02:41:54,450 --> 02:41:57,080
...behind the hills...

1554
02:41:58,990 --> 02:42:00,620
...into Shadow.

1555
02:42:09,070 --> 02:42:12,510
How did it come to this?

1556
02:42:33,790 --> 02:42:35,660
It's been going for hours.

1557
02:42:36,800 --> 02:42:39,230
They must have decided something
by now.

1558
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:43,490
Decided? No.

1559
02:42:43,670 --> 02:42:48,800
We only just finished saying...

1560
02:42:50,010 --> 02:42:51,870
...good morning.

1561
02:42:53,210 --> 02:42:56,410
But it's nighttime already.

1562
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:58,380
You can't take forever.

1563
02:42:59,380 --> 02:43:01,440
Don't be hasty.

1564
02:43:01,890 --> 02:43:04,290
We're running out of time!

1565
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:10,260
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1566
02:43:27,810 --> 02:43:29,140
Give me your sword.

1567
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:39,820
What is your name?

1568
02:43:40,360 --> 02:43:42,720
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

1569
02:43:44,860 --> 02:43:47,490
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1570
02:43:49,470 --> 02:43:51,430
They say that it is hopeless.

1571
02:44:09,250 --> 02:44:10,880
This is a good sword.

1572
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:15,250
Haleth, son of Hama...

1573
02:44:19,590 --> 02:44:21,750
...there is always hope.

1574
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:48,080
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1575
02:44:48,250 --> 02:44:49,810
Forgive me.

1576
02:44:49,990 --> 02:44:51,420
I was wrong to despair.

1577
02:45:00,630 --> 02:45:03,430
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1578
02:45:06,870 --> 02:45:08,930
It's a little tight across the chest.

1579
02:45:15,110 --> 02:45:17,080
That is no Orc horn.

1580
02:45:22,760 --> 02:45:24,590
Send for the king.

1581
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:28,350
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1582
02:46:00,020 --> 02:46:01,690
How is this possible?

1583
02:46:02,690 --> 02:46:06,320
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1584
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:09,730
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1585
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:14,670
Long ago we fought and died together.

1586
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:19,840
We come to honor that allegiance.

1587
02:46:28,320 --> 02:46:30,250
You are most welcome.

1588
02:46:35,620 --> 02:46:39,560
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1589
02:47:13,190 --> 02:47:16,460
You could have picked a better spot.

1590
02:47:21,330 --> 02:47:25,530
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1591
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:33,470
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1592
02:47:34,110 --> 02:47:36,600
Let's hope they last the night.

1593
02:49:18,050 --> 02:49:20,840
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1594
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:23,910
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1595
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:28,910
So it begins.

1596
02:50:55,770 --> 02:50:57,140
Did they hit anything?

1597
02:50:57,810 --> 02:50:59,800
Give them a volley.

1598
02:50:59,980 --> 02:51:02,070
- Fire!
- Fire!

1599
02:51:17,790 --> 02:51:19,490
Send them to me! Come on!

1600
02:51:40,250 --> 02:51:41,340
Good!

1601
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:51,110
Swords! Swords!

1602
02:52:29,190 --> 02:52:31,320
Legolas! Two already!

1603
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:33,620
I'm on 17!

1604
02:52:33,800 --> 02:52:36,360
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1605
02:52:43,170 --> 02:52:44,900
Nineteen!

1606
02:53:10,870 --> 02:53:12,300
Merry.

1607
02:53:16,710 --> 02:53:20,510
We have just agreed.

1608
02:53:30,520 --> 02:53:31,990
Yes?

1609
02:53:33,490 --> 02:53:37,650
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1610
02:53:38,790 --> 02:53:42,030
...and we have agreed...

1611
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:46,520
...you are not Orcs.

1612
02:53:48,270 --> 02:53:50,400
Well, that's good news.

1613
02:53:50,570 --> 02:53:54,700
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1614
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:59,140
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1615
02:53:59,310 --> 02:54:00,840
Hasty?

1616
02:54:01,620 --> 02:54:03,520
Our friends are out there.

1617
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:07,850
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1618
02:54:08,190 --> 02:54:10,450
War? Yes.

1619
02:54:10,620 --> 02:54:12,520
It affects us all.

1620
02:54:12,690 --> 02:54:15,680
Tree, root and twig.

1621
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:20,590
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1622
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:22,740
...it takes a long time...

1623
02:54:22,900 --> 02:54:27,810
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1624
02:54:27,980 --> 02:54:32,210
...and we never say anything...

1625
02:54:32,380 --> 02:54:36,280
...unless it is worth taking...

1626
02:54:36,450 --> 02:54:40,510
...a long time to say.

1627
02:54:41,290 --> 02:54:44,590
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1628
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:45,820
Nineteen!

1629
02:54:46,390 --> 02:54:48,260
Twenty!

1630
02:54:48,430 --> 02:54:50,090
Twenty-one!

1631
02:55:00,170 --> 02:55:02,160
Causeway!

1632
02:55:09,950 --> 02:55:12,310
Is this it?

1633
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:15,420
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1634
02:56:41,400 --> 02:56:42,770
Brace the gate!

1635
02:57:01,090 --> 02:57:03,350
Hold them! Stand firm!

1636
02:57:11,230 --> 02:57:12,560
Aragorn!

1637
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:18,400
Gimli!

1638
02:58:07,150 --> 02:58:11,090
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1639
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:15,880
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1640
02:58:16,690 --> 02:58:18,780
How can that be your decision?!

1641
02:58:19,460 --> 02:58:23,090
This is not our war.

1642
02:58:23,400 --> 02:58:25,590
But you're part of this world!

1643
02:58:29,740 --> 02:58:31,570
Aren't you?!

1644
02:58:35,650 --> 02:58:38,010
You must help. Please.

1645
02:58:39,310 --> 02:58:42,080
You must do something.

1646
02:58:42,350 --> 02:58:46,650
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1647
02:58:47,860 --> 02:58:51,590
But your part in this tale is over.

1648
02:58:51,760 --> 02:58:53,990
Go back to your home.

1649
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,270
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1650
02:59:06,440 --> 02:59:08,310
We don't belong here, Merry.

1651
02:59:08,480 --> 02:59:10,740
It's too big for us.

1652
02:59:10,910 --> 02:59:13,570
What can we do in the end?

1653
02:59:15,880 --> 02:59:18,510
We've got the Shire.

1654
02:59:19,050 --> 02:59:21,580
Maybe we should go home.

1655
02:59:23,420 --> 02:59:26,660
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1656
02:59:26,830 --> 02:59:31,730
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1657
02:59:31,900 --> 02:59:33,490
And...

1658
02:59:35,300 --> 02:59:38,360
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1659
02:59:41,910 --> 02:59:44,840
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1660
03:00:04,360 --> 03:00:05,590
Aragorn!

1661
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:08,130
Fall back to the Keep!

1662
03:00:08,300 --> 03:00:11,390
Get your men out of there!

1663
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:22,710
Haldir!

1664
03:00:26,820 --> 03:00:30,080
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1665
03:00:49,300 --> 03:00:50,530
Haldir!

1666
03:01:33,210 --> 03:01:34,700
Brace the gate!

1667
03:01:36,950 --> 03:01:38,250
Hold them!

1668
03:01:40,090 --> 03:01:43,450
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1669
03:02:11,590 --> 03:02:13,520
Make way!

1670
03:02:16,420 --> 03:02:18,150
We cannot hold much longer!

1671
03:02:24,130 --> 03:02:27,690
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1672
03:02:27,870 --> 03:02:30,430
As long as you can give me.

1673
03:02:30,600 --> 03:02:32,260
Gimli!

1674
03:02:33,740 --> 03:02:35,100
Timbers!

1675
03:02:35,270 --> 03:02:37,240
Brace the gate!

1676
03:02:52,020 --> 03:02:53,720
Come on. We can take them.

1677
03:02:54,560 --> 03:02:56,190
It's a long way.

1678
03:03:01,430 --> 03:03:03,190
Toss me.

1679
03:03:04,370 --> 03:03:06,200
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1680
03:03:06,370 --> 03:03:07,930
You'll have to toss me!

1681
03:03:13,540 --> 03:03:14,800
Don't tell the Elf.

1682
03:03:15,340 --> 03:03:17,110
Not a word.

1683
03:03:32,360 --> 03:03:33,790
Shore up the door!

1684
03:03:33,960 --> 03:03:36,060
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1685
03:03:36,230 --> 03:03:37,290
Watch our backs!

1686
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:43,670
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1687
03:04:33,620 --> 03:04:35,020
Hold fast the gate!

1688
03:04:39,260 --> 03:04:42,190
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1689
03:04:46,930 --> 03:04:48,520
Aragorn!

1690
03:05:21,970 --> 03:05:24,400
Pull everybody back.

1691
03:05:24,770 --> 03:05:26,570
Pull them back.

1692
03:05:27,100 --> 03:05:28,570
Fall back!

1693
03:05:28,740 --> 03:05:31,230
Fall back!

1694
03:05:32,410 --> 03:05:34,100
They have broken through!

1695
03:05:34,280 --> 03:05:36,540
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1696
03:05:36,710 --> 03:05:38,940
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1697
03:05:39,110 --> 03:05:41,710
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1698
03:05:41,890 --> 03:05:44,150
Into the Keep!

1699
03:05:55,600 --> 03:06:00,560
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1700
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:05,430
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1701
03:06:11,180 --> 03:06:12,440
Wait! Stop!

1702
03:06:13,350 --> 03:06:14,840
Stop!

1703
03:06:17,950 --> 03:06:19,680
Turn around.

1704
03:06:20,590 --> 03:06:23,280
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1705
03:06:23,460 --> 03:06:28,450
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1706
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:31,490
Yes. Exactly.

1707
03:06:31,670 --> 03:06:34,900
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1708
03:06:35,070 --> 03:06:37,730
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1709
03:06:37,900 --> 03:06:39,890
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1710
03:06:42,510 --> 03:06:45,540
That doesn't make sense to me.

1711
03:06:45,710 --> 03:06:46,870
But then...

1712
03:06:47,050 --> 03:06:49,740
...you are very small.

1713
03:06:50,220 --> 03:06:51,980
Perhaps you're right.

1714
03:06:54,620 --> 03:06:56,140
South it is, then.

1715
03:06:57,660 --> 03:07:00,990
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1716
03:07:03,030 --> 03:07:05,790
I always like going south.

1717
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:10,270
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1718
03:07:10,870 --> 03:07:13,340
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1719
03:07:13,510 --> 03:07:15,440
No, we won't.

1720
03:07:16,180 --> 03:07:18,440
Not this time.

1721
03:07:25,080 --> 03:07:26,110
Look!

1722
03:07:27,750 --> 03:07:30,190
Osgiliath burns!

1723
03:07:30,350 --> 03:07:31,790
Mordor has come.

1724
03:07:32,920 --> 03:07:35,320
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1725
03:07:36,660 --> 03:07:38,860
It has only the power to destroy.

1726
03:07:39,760 --> 03:07:41,200
Please...

1727
03:07:41,360 --> 03:07:42,990
...let me go.

1728
03:07:44,030 --> 03:07:45,630
Hurry.

1729
03:07:49,110 --> 03:07:50,510
Faramir!

1730
03:07:50,670 --> 03:07:53,170
You must let me go!

1731
03:07:53,610 --> 03:07:57,050
And those little family of field mice...

1732
03:07:57,210 --> 03:08:00,050
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1733
03:08:00,780 --> 03:08:04,080
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1734
03:08:15,260 --> 03:08:18,200
Many of these trees were my friends.

1735
03:08:18,900 --> 03:08:23,530
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1736
03:08:24,710 --> 03:08:25,900
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1737
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:28,840
They had voices of their own.

1738
03:08:31,080 --> 03:08:33,640
Saruman.

1739
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:37,040
A wizard should know better!

1740
03:08:51,330 --> 03:08:54,960
There is no curse in Elvish...

1741
03:08:55,170 --> 03:08:57,830
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1742
03:08:58,010 --> 03:09:00,340
...for this treachery.

1743
03:09:01,740 --> 03:09:04,570
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1744
03:09:09,280 --> 03:09:10,480
Where are they going?

1745
03:09:11,020 --> 03:09:14,250
They have business with the Orcs.

1746
03:09:14,720 --> 03:09:18,990
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1747
03:09:19,160 --> 03:09:21,790
...with rock and stone.

1748
03:09:45,720 --> 03:09:46,840
Yes.

1749
03:09:47,950 --> 03:09:49,390
Come, my friends.

1750
03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:54,920
The Ents are going to war.

1751
03:09:55,090 --> 03:09:56,860
It is likely...

1752
03:09:57,030 --> 03:10:00,560
...that we go to our doom.

1753
03:10:01,970 --> 03:10:04,430
Last march...

1754
03:10:04,970 --> 03:10:06,990
...of the Ents.

1755
03:10:55,120 --> 03:10:58,850
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1756
03:10:59,020 --> 03:11:01,080
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1757
03:11:03,860 --> 03:11:05,330
Mr. Frodo?

1758
03:11:05,630 --> 03:11:09,720
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1759
03:11:09,900 --> 03:11:12,390
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1760
03:11:26,710 --> 03:11:28,110
Take them to my father.

1761
03:11:29,680 --> 03:11:32,680
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1762
03:11:35,090 --> 03:11:38,110
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1763
03:11:39,290 --> 03:11:41,990
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1764
03:11:42,630 --> 03:11:45,390
You want to know
why your brother died?

1765
03:11:45,900 --> 03:11:49,630
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1766
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:51,700
He tried to kill him!

1767
03:11:51,870 --> 03:11:54,200
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1768
03:11:54,970 --> 03:11:56,840
Watch out!

1769
03:12:07,750 --> 03:12:08,880
Mr. Frodo?

1770
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:13,360
They're here.

1771
03:12:16,460 --> 03:12:18,930
They've come.

1772
03:12:21,500 --> 03:12:23,400
Nazgul!

1773
03:12:45,520 --> 03:12:47,680
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1774
03:12:49,490 --> 03:12:51,720
Take cover!

1775
03:13:09,050 --> 03:13:10,600
The fortress is taken.

1776
03:13:11,380 --> 03:13:12,570
It is over.

1777
03:13:12,750 --> 03:13:16,680
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1778
03:13:16,850 --> 03:13:19,790
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1779
03:13:22,520 --> 03:13:23,920
They're breaking in!

1780
03:13:26,560 --> 03:13:29,050
They're past the door!

1781
03:13:32,400 --> 03:13:36,530
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1782
03:13:39,210 --> 03:13:41,140
Is there no other way?

1783
03:13:42,710 --> 03:13:45,770
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1784
03:13:46,450 --> 03:13:48,640
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1785
03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:55,920
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1786
03:13:56,090 --> 03:13:58,960
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1787
03:14:01,130 --> 03:14:04,530
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1788
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:10,640
Ride out with me.

1789
03:14:14,740 --> 03:14:16,370
Ride out and meet them.

1790
03:14:17,140 --> 03:14:19,300
For death and glory.

1791
03:14:19,480 --> 03:14:20,880
For Rohan.

1792
03:14:22,380 --> 03:14:23,850
For your people.

1793
03:14:24,580 --> 03:14:26,520
The sun is rising.

1794
03:14:31,020 --> 03:14:34,020
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

1795
03:14:34,190 --> 03:14:35,590
At dawn...

1796
03:14:35,760 --> 03:14:37,460
...look to the east.

1797
03:14:41,670 --> 03:14:43,290
Yes.

1798
03:14:45,770 --> 03:14:47,430
Yes.

1799
03:14:48,770 --> 03:14:51,170
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1800
03:14:51,340 --> 03:14:54,140
...shall sound in the Deep...

1801
03:14:54,580 --> 03:14:56,570
...one last time.

1802
03:14:56,750 --> 03:14:58,240
Yes!

1803
03:15:01,290 --> 03:15:05,080
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1804
03:15:12,860 --> 03:15:14,190
Fell deeds, awake.

1805
03:15:15,400 --> 03:15:16,490
Now for wrath...

1806
03:15:16,670 --> 03:15:20,070
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1807
03:15:27,110 --> 03:15:29,370
Forth Eorlingas!

1808
03:16:17,160 --> 03:16:18,390
Gandalf.

1809
03:16:25,670 --> 03:16:29,330
Theoden King stands alone.

1810
03:16:29,940 --> 03:16:32,100
Not alone.

1811
03:16:32,510 --> 03:16:33,630
Rohirrim!

1812
03:16:39,550 --> 03:16:40,710
Eomer.

1813
03:16:40,880 --> 03:16:43,410
To the king!

1814
03:18:01,020 --> 03:18:02,790
Yes!

1815
03:18:11,930 --> 03:18:15,370
A hit. A fine hit.

1816
03:18:39,930 --> 03:18:42,400
Break the dam!

1817
03:18:42,560 --> 03:18:46,000
Release the river!

1818
03:19:13,330 --> 03:19:16,060
Pippin! Hold on!

1819
03:19:21,330 --> 03:19:24,270
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1820
03:20:05,610 --> 03:20:07,640
What are you doing?

1821
03:20:16,220 --> 03:20:17,780
Where are you going?

1822
03:21:15,940 --> 03:21:17,270
It's me.

1823
03:21:19,780 --> 03:21:21,970
It's your Sam.

1824
03:21:26,320 --> 03:21:28,950
Don't you know your Sam?

1825
03:21:46,670 --> 03:21:50,040
I can't do this, Sam.

1826
03:21:50,940 --> 03:21:52,930
I know.

1827
03:21:53,940 --> 03:21:56,310
It's all wrong.

1828
03:21:57,050 --> 03:21:59,070
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1829
03:22:06,490 --> 03:22:08,590
But we are.

1830
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:18,030
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1831
03:22:18,200 --> 03:22:20,600
The ones that really mattered.

1832
03:22:21,640 --> 03:22:24,630
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1833
03:22:24,810 --> 03:22:27,780
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1834
03:22:27,950 --> 03:22:30,880
...because how could the end be happy?

1835
03:22:33,450 --> 03:22:35,640
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

1836
03:22:35,820 --> 03:22:39,310
...when so much bad had happened?

1837
03:22:40,160 --> 03:22:42,060
Victory!

1838
03:22:42,230 --> 03:22:43,780
We have victory!

1839
03:22:43,960 --> 03:22:47,900
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...

1840
03:22:48,070 --> 03:22:49,400
...this shadow.

1841
03:22:49,570 --> 03:22:51,970
Even darkness must pass.

1842
03:22:52,140 --> 03:22:54,830
A new day will come.

1843
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:58,960
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

1844
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:03,240
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

1845
03:23:03,410 --> 03:23:05,180
...that meant something.

1846
03:23:05,350 --> 03:23:07,910
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1847
03:23:09,280 --> 03:23:13,150
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1848
03:23:13,320 --> 03:23:14,880
I know now.

1849
03:23:15,720 --> 03:23:17,920
Folk in those stories...

1850
03:23:18,090 --> 03:23:22,220
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1851
03:23:22,400 --> 03:23:24,630
They kept going...

1852
03:23:25,300 --> 03:23:28,570
...because they were holding
on to something.

1853
03:23:30,170 --> 03:23:32,470
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1854
03:23:44,420 --> 03:23:48,350
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1855
03:23:48,620 --> 03:23:51,250
And it's worth fighting for.

1856
03:24:18,150 --> 03:24:22,450
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1857
03:24:23,190 --> 03:24:27,150
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1858
03:24:27,330 --> 03:24:29,520
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1859
03:24:33,900 --> 03:24:35,300
Then it is forfeit.

1860
03:24:38,030 --> 03:24:39,830
Release them.

1861
03:24:51,880 --> 03:24:53,940
Stay out of the forest!

1862
03:24:54,120 --> 03:24:55,920
Keep away from the trees!

1863
03:25:46,740 --> 03:25:48,530
Final count...

1864
03:25:48,700 --> 03:25:51,610
- ... 42.
- Forty-two?

1865
03:25:53,070 --> 03:25:57,840
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1866
03:25:58,650 --> 03:26:02,310
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1867
03:26:06,420 --> 03:26:09,720
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

1868
03:26:10,490 --> 03:26:12,980
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1869
03:26:13,160 --> 03:26:17,860
...because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1870
03:26:20,070 --> 03:26:24,770
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1871
03:26:25,040 --> 03:26:28,570
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1872
03:26:28,740 --> 03:26:31,710
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1873
03:26:31,880 --> 03:26:34,710
I hear the staff are very good.

1874
03:26:40,390 --> 03:26:42,750
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1875
03:26:42,920 --> 03:26:47,190
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1876
03:26:47,360 --> 03:26:48,590
I'm starving.

1877
03:26:48,760 --> 03:26:51,850
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1878
03:26:52,030 --> 03:26:55,090
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1879
03:27:19,060 --> 03:27:21,460
Saruman's storeroom!

1880
03:27:23,790 --> 03:27:26,520
I don't believe it.

1881
03:27:26,700 --> 03:27:28,760
It can't be.

1882
03:27:29,370 --> 03:27:32,270
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1883
03:27:33,570 --> 03:27:35,870
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1884
03:27:36,240 --> 03:27:39,330
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1885
03:27:39,510 --> 03:27:40,630
Wait.

1886
03:27:41,380 --> 03:27:42,610
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1887
03:27:42,780 --> 03:27:44,300
Share it?

1888
03:27:46,150 --> 03:27:48,550
No. No.

1889
03:27:50,050 --> 03:27:51,380
Dead plant and all that.

1890
03:27:51,820 --> 03:27:53,980
Don't think he'd understand.

1891
03:27:55,260 --> 03:27:57,450
Could be a distant relative.

1892
03:27:58,230 --> 03:28:00,750
I get it.

1893
03:28:00,930 --> 03:28:03,730
Don't be hasty.

1894
03:28:04,830 --> 03:28:06,600
Exactly.

1895
03:28:07,670 --> 03:28:09,930
Bar-hrum.

1896
03:28:35,560 --> 03:28:36,860
This is the old sewer.

1897
03:28:37,030 --> 03:28:40,160
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1898
03:28:40,330 --> 03:28:42,060
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1899
03:28:43,140 --> 03:28:45,610
Captain Faramir...

1900
03:28:46,240 --> 03:28:48,070
...you have shown your quality, sir.

1901
03:28:50,580 --> 03:28:51,870
The very highest.

1902
03:28:52,380 --> 03:28:55,010
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

1903
03:28:55,180 --> 03:28:58,120
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

1904
03:28:59,320 --> 03:29:01,290
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1905
03:29:01,890 --> 03:29:03,450
Gollum says there's a path...

1906
03:29:03,620 --> 03:29:07,560
...near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1907
03:29:08,030 --> 03:29:09,760
Cirith Ungol?

1908
03:29:13,300 --> 03:29:15,860
- Is that its name?
- No.

1909
03:29:16,040 --> 03:29:17,700
No!

1910
03:29:18,540 --> 03:29:21,530
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1911
03:29:21,910 --> 03:29:25,430
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1912
03:29:26,350 --> 03:29:28,870
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1913
03:29:29,210 --> 03:29:35,480
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1914
03:29:36,990 --> 03:29:38,780
I must.

1915
03:29:42,360 --> 03:29:45,920
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1916
03:29:46,100 --> 03:29:48,120
Thank you.

1917
03:29:59,940 --> 03:30:04,070
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1918
03:30:16,520 --> 03:30:18,080
Come on, keep up.

1919
03:30:21,530 --> 03:30:24,330
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1920
03:30:24,970 --> 03:30:26,800
You know that, don't you?

1921
03:30:27,600 --> 03:30:29,160
He was trying to save you, see?

1922
03:30:29,670 --> 03:30:31,200
Save me?

1923
03:30:31,540 --> 03:30:33,700
So there's no hard feelings.

1924
03:30:33,880 --> 03:30:39,010
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1925
03:30:39,180 --> 03:30:41,810
Gollum, Gollum.

1926
03:30:42,850 --> 03:30:44,610
Yes, master.

1927
03:30:45,690 --> 03:30:48,520
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

1928
03:30:48,690 --> 03:30:50,990
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1929
03:30:56,500 --> 03:31:01,700
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1930
03:31:08,840 --> 03:31:11,830
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1931
03:31:12,510 --> 03:31:16,040
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1932
03:31:21,190 --> 03:31:24,620
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1933
03:31:25,590 --> 03:31:28,820
...somewhere in the wilderness.

1934
03:31:32,130 --> 03:31:35,530
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1935
03:31:35,700 --> 03:31:37,070
What?

1936
03:31:37,240 --> 03:31:41,190
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "

1937
03:31:41,370 --> 03:31:44,640
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories. "

1938
03:31:44,810 --> 03:31:47,740
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1939
03:31:47,910 --> 03:31:49,570
"Yes, my boy.

1940
03:31:49,750 --> 03:31:53,550
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "

1941
03:31:53,720 --> 03:31:56,240
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1942
03:31:56,420 --> 03:31:58,320
"Samwise the Brave. "

1943
03:31:58,490 --> 03:32:01,220
I want to hear more about Sam.

1944
03:32:05,530 --> 03:32:08,520
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1945
03:32:09,870 --> 03:32:13,890
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1946
03:32:15,010 --> 03:32:16,370
So was I.

1947
03:32:25,250 --> 03:32:27,950
"Samwise the Brave. "

1948
03:32:32,220 --> 03:32:33,550
Smeagol?

1949
03:32:33,720 --> 03:32:36,620
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1950
03:32:36,790 --> 03:32:38,730
Master.

1951
03:32:38,890 --> 03:32:41,860
Master looks after us.

1952
03:32:42,630 --> 03:32:45,430
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1953
03:32:45,600 --> 03:32:48,070
Master broke his promise.

1954
03:32:48,240 --> 03:32:50,400
Don't ask Smeagol.

1955
03:32:50,570 --> 03:32:53,770
Poor, poor Smeagol.

1956
03:32:53,940 --> 03:32:56,770
Master betrayed us.

1957
03:32:56,940 --> 03:33:00,040
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1958
03:33:00,220 --> 03:33:04,120
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1959
03:33:04,290 --> 03:33:07,020
Kill him! Kill him!

1960
03:33:07,190 --> 03:33:08,680
Kill them both!

1961
03:33:08,860 --> 03:33:12,490
And then we take the precious...

1962
03:33:12,660 --> 03:33:16,190
...and we be the master!

1963
03:33:16,860 --> 03:33:19,530
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1964
03:33:19,700 --> 03:33:22,360
Eyes always watching.

1965
03:33:22,540 --> 03:33:26,100
Then we stabs them out.

1966
03:33:26,270 --> 03:33:30,770
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1967
03:33:30,940 --> 03:33:34,400
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1968
03:33:34,580 --> 03:33:37,280
Kill them both.

1969
03:33:37,450 --> 03:33:39,940
Yes. No! No!

1970
03:33:40,120 --> 03:33:43,820
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1971
03:33:44,520 --> 03:33:47,120
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1972
03:33:47,290 --> 03:33:49,890
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Smeagol?

1973
03:33:50,060 --> 03:33:55,470
We could let her do it.

1974
03:33:56,440 --> 03:34:00,560
Yes. She could do it.

1975
03:34:00,740 --> 03:34:05,300
Yes, precious, she could.

1976
03:34:05,480 --> 03:34:11,510
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1977
03:34:12,450 --> 03:34:15,280
Once they're dead.

1978
03:34:19,690 --> 03:34:23,390
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1979
03:34:23,560 --> 03:34:25,620
Smeagol will show you the way.
