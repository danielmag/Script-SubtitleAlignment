Ooh, yes.

360
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:59,071
Right, uh, Mr. Thacker.
Will you come this way.

361
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:01,471
Right.

362
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:04,271
KAREN:You've got five minutes.

363
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:15,752
WILLIAM:- Hi.
ANNA:- Hello.

364
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:19,632
WILLIAM:Uh, I brought these, but clearly--

365
00:25:19,712 --> 00:25:23,352
ANNA:No, they're great.
They're great.

366
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:26,152
WILLIAM:Ah, listen,
I'm sorry about not ringing back.

367
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:28,072
WILLIAM:The whole "two-names concept"...

368
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,552
WILLIAM:was totally too much for my flatmate's
pea-sized intellect.

369
00:25:30,632 --> 00:25:34,312
ANNA:No, it's a stupid privacy thing.
I always pick a... cartoon character.

370
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,512
ANNA:Last time I was Mrs. Bambi.

371
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:39,232
[ Door Closes ]

372
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,393
JEREMY:- Everything all right?
ANNA:- Yes, thank you.

373
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:45,153
JEREMY:And you're from, uh,
Horse & Hound.

374
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:47,713
- Yeah.
- Good.

375
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:50,393
ANNA:Is that so? Well.

376
00:25:56,113 --> 00:25:58,153
WILLIAM:So, uh--

377
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:06,153
WILLIAM:Uh, I'll just... fire away then,
shall I?

378
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:09,634
WILLIAM:Right.

379
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:11,594
WILLIAM:Uh--

380
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:16,154
WILLIAM:The film's great, and, um,

381
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:19,074
WILLIAM:I just was wondering whether...

382
00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:21,234
WILLIAM:you ever thought of having, um,

383
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:24,874
WILLIAM:more, uh, horses in it.

385
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:31,274
ANNA:Uh, well, we would have liked to,

386
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:36,474
ANNA:but it was, um, difficult,
obviously, being set in space.

387
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:41,595
WILLIAM:Space, right, yeah.
Yeah, obviously very difficult.

388
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:44,795
WILLIAM:I'm so sorry.
I arrived outside.

389
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,755
WILLIAM:They thrust this thing
into my hand--

390
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:49,955
ANNA:WILLIAM:No, it's my fault.
I thought this would all be over by now.

391
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:52,675
ANNA:I just wanted to sort of apologize
for the kissing thing.

392
00:26:52,715 --> 00:26:54,595
ANNA:I seriously don't know
what came over me.

393
00:26:54,635 --> 00:26:57,515
ANNA:And I just wanted to make sure
that you were fine about it.

394
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:04,515
WILLIAM:- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely fine.

395
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:08,596
JEREMY:WILLIAM:Do remember that Miss Scott is also
keen to talk about her next project...

396
00:27:08,676 --> 00:27:12,196
JEREMY:which is, um, shooting
later in the summer.

397
00:27:12,276 --> 00:27:15,596
WILLIAM:Ah, yes, excellent.
Excellent.

398
00:27:20,396 --> 00:27:24,356
WILLIAM:Any horses in that one?

399
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:29,636
WILLIAM:Or hounds for that matter. Our readers
are equally intrigued by both species.

400
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:32,356
WILLIAM:It takes place on a submarine.

401
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:35,757
WILLIAM:Oh. Well, bad luck.

402
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:39,637
WILLIAM:But, um,

403
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:41,917
WILLIAM:if there were horses in it,

404
00:27:41,997 --> 00:27:44,477
WILLIAM:would you be riding them...

405
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:48,997
WILLIAM:or would you be getting, a--
a stunt-horse-double-man-thing?

406
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:55,917
WILLIAM:[ Chuckles ] I-- I'm a complete moron.
I apologize. I--

407
00:27:55,997 --> 00:27:59,757
WILLIAM:This is very weird. It's the sort
of thing that happens in dreams,

408
00:27:59,797 --> 00:28:02,277
WILLIAM:not in real life.

409
00:28:02,357 --> 00:28:04,758
WILLIAM:I mean, good dreams.
It's a--

410
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:08,238
WILLIAM:it's a dream, in fact,
uh, to see you again.

411
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:13,278
ANNA:What happens next in the dream?

412
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:19,278
WILLIAM:I suppose in the, uh, dream--

413
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:22,758
WILLIAM:dream scenario--
I just, uh,

414
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:24,918
WILLIAM:change my personality...

415
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:27,518
WILLIAM:because you can do that
in dreams and, um,

416
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:33,879
WILLIAM:walk over and, uh, kiss the girl.

417
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,479
WILLIAM:But, uh--

418
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,399
JEREMY:Time's up, I'm afraid.
Did you get what you wanted?

419
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:52,479
WILLIAM:- Um, nearly, nearly.
JEREMY:- Well, maybe just one last question.

420
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,319
- Sure.
WILLIAM:- Right, right.

422
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,080
WILLIAM:Are you... busy tonight?

423
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,840
ANNA:- Yes.
- Right. Right.

424
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,160

ANNA:- Well, it was nice to meet you.

425
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,400
Yes, and you.

426
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,800
ANNA:Surreal... but nice.

427
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,080
WILLIAM:Thank you. You are Horse & Hounds'
favorite actress.

428
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,760
WILLIAM:You and Black Beauty...

429
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,680
WILLIAM:tied.

430
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:34,441
TARQUIN:How was she?

431
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:37,881
WILLIAM:Oh, um, fabulous.

432
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:41,881
TARQUIN:Excellent. Wait a minute.
She took your grandmother's flowers.

433
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:45,361
WILLIAM:Uh, yeah, yeah.
That's right.

434
00:29:45,441 --> 00:29:47,401
WILLIAM:- Bitch.
KAREN:- Oh, Mr. Thacker.

435
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:51,721
KAREN:Mr. Thacker, if you'd like to come with
me, we can rush you through the others.

436
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:53,161
WILLIAM:The others?

437
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,721
KAREN:Mr. Thacker is from Horse & Hound.

438
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:01,162
MALE LEAD:- How's it going?
MALE LEAD:- Very well, thank you.

439
00:30:01,242 --> 00:30:04,322
Have a seat.

440
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:07,442
MALE LEAD:- Well, did you enjoy the film?

441
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:10,442
WILLIAM:Yes, enormously.

442
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,282
MALE LEAD:- Well, fire away.
WILLIAM:- Right.

443
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:16,002
WILLIAM:Did you enjoy making the film?

444
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:19,842
MALE LEAD:- Yes, I did.
- Good.

445
00:30:19,882 --> 00:30:22,242
WILLIAM:Any bit in particular?

446
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:25,322
MALE LEAD:You tell me what bit
you enjoyed the most,

447
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:28,283
MALE LEAD:and I'll tell you
if I enjoyed making that bit.

448
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:33,803
WILLIAM:Uh, l...

449
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:36,763
WILLIAM:liked the bit in space...

450
00:30:36,843 --> 00:30:38,723
WILLIAM:very much.

451
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:42,203
WILLIAM:WILLIAM:Did you identify with the character
you're playing?

453
00:30:45,763 --> 00:30:49,723
INTERPRETER:- No.
INTERPRETER:- No.

454
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:55,164
WILLIAM:INTERPRETER:Oh. Why not?

457
00:31:01,324 --> 00:31:04,844
INTERPRETER:Because he's playing
a psychopathic flesh-eating robot.

458
00:31:04,924 --> 00:31:07,044
WILLIAM:Classic.

459
00:31:07,124 --> 00:31:09,804
WILLIAM:So, uh,

460
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:12,364

GIRL:No. It's my 22nd.

462
00:31:15,244 --> 00:31:19,044

Any favorites among the 22?

463
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:22,244
GIRL:Working with Leonardo.

464
00:31:22,324 --> 00:31:26,205
WILLIAM:- Da Vinci?

465
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:29,045

I'm not doing anymore.

474
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:04,446
ANNA:I told them I had
to spend the evening...

475
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:08,166
ANNA:with Britain's premier
equestrian journalist.

476
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:11,166
WILLIAM:Oh. Well, great.

477
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:13,366
WILLIAM:Fantastic.
That's, uh--

478
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:16,526
WILLIAM:Oh. Shittity brickitty.

479
00:32:16,606 --> 00:32:20,007
WILLIAM:It's my sister's birthday. Shit.
We're meant to be having dinner.

480
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:22,887
ANNA:- Okay, that's fine.
WILLIAM:- No. I'm sure I can get out of it.

481
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:26,247
ANNA:No, I mean, if it's fine with you,
I'll be your date.

482
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,727
WILLIAM:You--
You'll be my date...

483

484
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:37,127
ANNA:- If it's all right.
WILLIAM:- Well, yeah, I'm sure it's all right.

485
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:38,967
WILLIAM:My friend Max is cooking,

486
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:41,887
WILLIAM:and he is generally acknowledged
to be the worst cook in the world.

487
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:46,247
WILLIAM:But, um, you know, you could hide
the food in your handbag or something.

488
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:50,368
ANNA:- Okay.
WILLIAM:- Okay.

489
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:56,008

490
00:32:56,088 --> 00:33:00,008
MAX:- Does the girl have a name?
BELLA:- Don't know. Wouldn't say.

491
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:02,728
MAX:Oh, Christ!
What is going on in there?

492
00:33:02,768 --> 00:33:06,408
MAX (cont'd):- Oh, God!

493
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,208
MAX:Hi. Come on in.
Vague food crisis.

494
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:18,849
BELLA:Hiya! Sorry.

495
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:21,729
BELLA:The guinea-fowl is proving
more complicated than expected.

496
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:24,609
WILLIAM:- He's cooking guinea-fowl?
BELLA:- Don't even ask.

497
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:27,409
ANNA:- Hi.
BELLA:- Hi.

00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,969
WILLIAM:Bella, this is Anna.

500
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:35,689
BELLA:- Right.

501
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:38,569

00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,810
WILLIAM:Hon, this is Anna. Anna, this is Honey.
She's my baby sister.

513
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,810
HONEY:Oh. Hi.

514
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,691
HONEY:Oh, God. This is one
of those key moments in life...

515
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:17,571
HONEY:when it's possible
you can be really genuinely cool...

516
00:34:17,611 --> 00:34:22,571
HONEY:and I-- I'm going to fail
just a hundred percent.

517
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:28,811
HONEY:I-- I absolutely,
totally and utterly adore you.

518
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:32,971
HONEY:And I just think... you are
the most beautiful woman in the world.

519
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:36,131
HONEY:And, more importantly,
I genuinely believe,

520
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:40,931
HONEY:and I've believed for some time now,
that we could be best friends.

521
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:43,812
HONEY:So what do you think?

523
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:47,692

524
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:52,172
ANNA:Well, happy birthday.

525
00:34:52,212 --> 00:34:57,092
HONEY:Oh, you gave me a present.
We're best friends already then.

526
00:34:57,132 --> 00:34:59,732
HONEY:Marry Will. He's a really nice guy.
Then we can be sisters.

527
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:02,092
ANNA:- Well, I'll think about it.

528
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,292
MAX:- That'll be Bernie.

529
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:09,692

530
00:35:09,772 --> 00:35:12,573
BERNIE:Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.

531
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:15,053
BERNIE:- Millions down the drain.
- Well done.

532
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:18,173
MAX:- Bernie, this is Anna.
BERNIE:- Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.

533
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:21,933
- And you.
BERNIE:- Honey bunny, # Happy birthday to you #

534
00:35:22,013 --> 00:35:24,693
- Hi, Bella.
- Hi.

535
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:28,293
BERNIE:Um, it-- it-- it's a hat.
You don't have to wear it or anything.

536
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:31,173
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

537
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,933
Hi.

538
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:36,493
- Hi.
- What?

539
00:35:36,573 --> 00:35:38,453
- Wine, Bernie?
- Mm.

540
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:40,854
MAX:- You haven't slept with her, have you?

541
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:43,254
WILLIAM:That is a cheap question, and
the answer is, of course, no comment.

542
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:45,174
MAX:- No comment means "yes".
WILLIAM:- No, it doesn't.

543
00:35:45,254 --> 00:35:47,094
MAX:- Do you ever masturbate?
WILLIAM:- Definitely no comment.

544
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:49,734
MAX:- You see, it means "yes".
BERNIE:- [ Honey ] Oh, my God!

545
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:54,134
BERNIE:So, uh, tell me,
um, Anna, what do you do?

546
00:35:54,214 --> 00:35:57,814
ANNA:- I'm an actress.
BERNIE:- Oh, splendid.

547
00:35:57,894 --> 00:35:59,814
BERNIE:What do you do?

548
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:03,534
BERNIE:I'm actually in the stock market myself,
so, uh, not really similar fields.

549
00:36:03,574 --> 00:36:06,574
BERNIE:Though, um-- um, I have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff.

550
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:10,975
BERNIE:Um-- uh, P. G. Wodehouse.
Farce, all that, you know.

551
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:13,575
BERNIE:"Careful there, Vicar."

552
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:16,775
BERNIE:Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,
though, acting.

553
00:36:16,815 --> 00:36:20,655
BERNIE:- The wages are a scandal, aren't they?
ANNA:- They can be.

554
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:22,615
BERNIE:I see friends from university--
clever chaps.

555
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:24,575
BERNIE:Been in the business longer than you.

556
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:29,175
BERNIE:They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.

557
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,495
BERNIE:You know, it's no life.

558
00:36:31,535 --> 00:36:35,735
BERNIE:- What sort of acting do you do?
ANNA:- Films, mainly.

559
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:40,496
BERNIE:Oh, splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies?

560
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:45,296
BERNIE:I mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid?

561
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,496
ANNA:Fifteen million dollars.

562
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:50,376
BERNIE:Right.

563
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:54,456
BERNIE:So that's, well, fairly good.

564
00:36:54,536 --> 00:36:56,496
MAX:BERNIE:Right, I think we're ready.

565
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:58,416
ANNA:- Ooh.
- Okay.

566
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,336
BELLA:ANNA:Bella, can you tell me
where I can find--

567
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:02,376
BELLA:Oh, sorry.
It's down the corridor on the right.

568
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:04,456
HONEY:I'll show you.

569
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:09,657
BELLA:[ Whispering ] Quickly, quickly.
Talk very, very quickly.

570
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:11,297
BELLA:What are you doing here
with Anna Scott?

571
00:37:11,377 --> 00:37:13,257
BERNIE:- Anna Scott?
BELLA:- Yes. Shut up!

572
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:15,257
BERNIE:- What, the film star?
BERNIE:- Shh!

573
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:17,857
BERNIE:- Oh, God!
- What?

574
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:20,657
BERNIE:- Oh, God. Oh, goddy God.
HONEY:- What did you say to her?

575
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:24,017
HONEY:I don't believe it.
I actually walked into the loo with her.

576
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:26,857
HONEY:I was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning her jeans.

577
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:29,257
HONEY:- She had to ask me to leave.
- Oh, God.

578
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:31,217
BELLA:- So you knew who she was?

579
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:33,457
BELLA:Of course I did, but he didn't.

580
00:37:33,497 --> 00:37:37,418
Well, not instantly, but I-- I--
I got away with it.

582
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:44,938
BELLA:- What do you think of the guinea-fowl?
ANNA:- I'm a vegetarian.

583
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:47,338
BELLA:Oh, God.

584
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:50,098
So, how's the guinea-fowl?

585
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:53,418
MAX:Best guinea-fowl
I've ever tasted.

592
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:29,619
MAX:Having you here, Anna, firmly
establishes what I've long suspected--

593
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,380
MAX:that we really are the most
desperate lot of underachievers.

594
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,260
BERNIE:- [ Bernie ] Shame.
MAX:- I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

595
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,580
MAX:In fact, I think it's something
we should take pride in.

596
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,780
MAX:I'm gonna give the last brownie
as a prize...

597
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,140
MAX:to the saddest act here.

598
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,820
- Uh-oh.
WILLIAM:- Bern.

599
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,980
BERNIE:Yeah, all right.
Well, obviously, it's me, isn't it?

600
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,980
BERNIE:I mean, I work in the city in a job
I don't understand,

601
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,420
BERNIE:and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me.

602
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,940
BERNIE:I haven't had a girlfriend since--
well, since puberty.

603
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,941
BERNIE:And... nobody fancies me.

604
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:03,461
BERNIE:And if these cheeks get any chubbier,
they never will.

605
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:07,181
HONEY:- Nonsense. I fancy you.
- Really?

606
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,741
HONEY:Yeah. Or I did
before you got so fat.

607
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:12,621
MAX:[ Max ] You see.
And unless I'm much mistaken,

608
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:15,221
MAX:your job still pays you
rather a lot of money...

609
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:17,621
MAX:whilst Honey here
earns 20 pence a week...

610
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:20,381
MAX:flogging her guts out
in London's worst record store.

611
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:23,461
HONEY:Yes! And I haven't got hair.
I've got feathers.

612
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:27,221
HONEY:And I've got funny goggly eyes.
And I'm attracted to cruel men.

613
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:29,742
HONEY:And, actually,
no one will marry me...

614
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:32,822
HONEY:because, um, my boosies
have actually started shrinking.

615
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:35,222
MAX:- [ Max ] You see, it's incredibly sad.
BELLA:- But on the other hand,

616
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:36,982
BELLA:her best friend is Anna Scott.

617
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:40,342
HONEY:That's true. I can't deny it.
She needs me. What can I say?

618
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:44,942
BELLA:And most of her limbs work, whereas
I'm stuck in this thing day and night,

619
00:39:45,022 --> 00:39:46,942
BELLA:in a house full of ramps.

620
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:49,782
BELLA:And to add insult
to serious injury,

621
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:54,902
BELLA:I've totally given up smoking,
my favorite thing.

622
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:59,143
BELLA:And, um, well, the truth is,

623
00:39:59,223 --> 00:40:01,343
BELLA:we can't have a baby.

624
00:40:06,783 --> 00:40:08,783
BERNIE:Oh, Belle.

625
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:12,183
BELLA:C'est la vie.

626
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:17,503
BELLA:Still, um, we're lucky in lots of ways.

627
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:20,463
BELLA:But surely that's worth a brownie.
[ Chuckling ]

628
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:27,024
MAX:Well, I don't know.
Look at William.

629
00:40:27,104 --> 00:40:30,144
MAX:- Very unsuccessful professionally.
- That's true.

630
00:40:30,184 --> 00:40:34,864
MAX:Divorced. Used to be handsome,
now kind of squidgy round the edges.

631
00:40:36,024 --> 00:40:38,704
MAX:And absolutely certain never
to hear from Anna again...

632
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:41,704
MAX:- once she's heard that his
nickname at school was--
- Floppy.

633
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:44,824
You did.
I can't believe it, you did.

634
00:40:44,864 --> 00:40:48,144
Thanks very much. Thank you.
Well, at least I get the last brownie.

635
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:50,064
ANNA:[ Max ]
I think so, yes.

636
00:40:50,144 --> 00:40:52,024
ANNA:Well, wait.
What about me?

637
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,425
MAX:I'm sorry?
You think you deserve the brownie?

638
00:40:57,505 --> 00:41:01,545
ANNA:[ Chuckles ]
Well, a shot at it at least, huh?

639
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,425
WILLIAM:You'll have to prove it.
This is a very, very good brownie.

640
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:07,065
WILLIAM:I'm gonna fight for it.

641
00:41:07,105 --> 00:41:10,345
ANNA:I've been on a diet
every day since I was 19,

642
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:13,625
ANNA:which basically means
I've been hungry for a decade.

644
00:41:15,745 --> 00:41:19,225
ANNA:I've had a series of not-nice
boyfriends, one of whom hit me.

645
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:22,226
ANNA:Uh, and every time
I get my heart broken,

646
00:41:22,306 --> 00:41:26,466
ANNA:the newspapers splash it about
as though it's entertainment.

647
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:33,346
ANNA:And... it's taken two rather painful,
um, operations...

648
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:35,306
ANNA:to get me looking like this.

649
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:38,386
HONEY:- Really?
ANNA:- Really.

650
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:45,026
ANNA:ANNA:And one day not long from now,
my looks will go,

651
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:47,826
ANNA:they will discover I can't act,

652
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:52,547
ANNA:and I will become
some sad, middle-aged woman...

653
00:41:52,627 --> 00:41:57,227
ANNA:who... looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.

654
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:07,227
MAX:No, nice try, gorgeous,
but you don't fool anyone.

655
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:09,787
- No.

656
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,747
WILLIAM:Pathetic effort
to hog the brownie.

657
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:16,947
ANNA:- Thank you for such a terrific time.
MAX:- I'm delighted.

658
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:21,148
ANNA:- That's a great tie.
MAX:- Now you're lying.

659
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,748
ANNA:Okay, it's true.
I told you I was bad at acting.

660
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:26,148
ANNA:- it was lovely to meet you.
BELLA:- Yeah, and you. And you.

661
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:28,868
BELLA:I'll wait until you've gone
before I tell him you're a vegetarian.

662
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:31,628
MAX:- No!
- Oh!

663
00:42:33,148 --> 00:42:36,508
ANNA:- Good night.
HONEY:- I'm so sorry about the loo thing.

664
00:42:36,548 --> 00:42:38,988
HONEY:I meant to leave.
I just-- [ Chuckles ]

665
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:41,388
HONEY:Ring me if you want someone
to go shopping with.

666
00:42:41,468 --> 00:42:44,828
HONEY:I know lots of nice, cheap places,
not that money is necessarily--

667
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:46,788
HONEY:it was just so nice to meet you.

668
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:49,629
ANNA:- Happy birthday. You're my style guru.
ANNA:- Thank you.

669
00:42:49,669 --> 00:42:51,749
- Sorry. Can I just--
ANNA:- Oh.

670
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:53,669
- Thanks.
- Leave her.

671
00:42:53,749 --> 00:42:55,589
- Good night, everyone.
- Bye.

672
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:58,469
ANNA:[ William ] Max, Belle,
we'll see you in a couple of days.

673
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,949
- Thank you, everybody. Call us.
ANNA:- Bye, guys.

674
00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:03,589
- Bye, Anna.
BERNIE:- Love your work.

675
00:43:03,629 --> 00:43:05,989
[ William ]
Bye, Hon.

678
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:15,909
WILLIAM:Sorry. They always do that
when I leave the house.

679
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:19,510
It's a stupid thing.
I hate it.

680
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,750
ANNA:- "Floppy", huh?
WILLIAM:- It's the hair.

681
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,150
- Mm-hmm.
WILLIAM:- It's to do with the hair.

682
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,830
ANNA:Why is she in a wheelchair?

683
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:43,150
WILLIAM:Uh, because she had an accident
about 18 months ago.

684
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,271
ANNA:And the pregnancy thing,
is that to do with the accident?

685
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:47,711
WILLIAM:You know, I'm not sure.

686
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:50,951
WILLIAM:I don't think they tried for kids
before, as fate would have it.

687
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:01,991
WILLIAM:Do you want to, um--

688
00:44:02,071 --> 00:44:05,071
WILLIAM:My place is just, um--

689
00:44:05,151 --> 00:44:07,231
ANNA:Too complicated.

690
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:09,511
WILLIAM:That's fine.

692
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:16,312
ANNA:Busy tomorrow?

693
00:44:18,312 --> 00:44:21,592
WILLIAM:- I thought you were leaving tomorrow.
ANNA:- I was.

694
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:28,752
WILLIAM:All these streets round here
have these mysterious communal gardens
in the middle of them.

695
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,112
WILLIAM:- They're like little villages.
ANNA:- Let's go in.

They're private villages.

WILLIAM:Only the people who live round the edges
are allowed in.

698

ANNA:Oh. You abide by rules like that?

699

But others do.

704
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,353
WILLIAM:- Nothing.
ANNA:- Yes, you did.

705
00:44:58,433 --> 00:45:02,393
WILLIAM:- No, I didn't.
ANNA:- You said, "Whoopsidaisies".

706
00:45:02,473 --> 00:45:05,633
WILLIAM:No one says, "Whoopsidaisies", do they?
I mean, unless they're--

707
00:45:05,673 --> 00:45:08,913

has said "Whoopsidaisies" for 50 years.

708
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:12,714

little girls with blonde ringlets.

So here we go again.

It's a clinical thing.

And I'm told it won't last long.

they've vanished.

what the film's like.

"Stay away, chum."

of the languages,

the same as the word for "prostitute"?

your conversation, but I did.

WILLIAM:the person you're talking about
is a real person.

792

WILLIAM:And I think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration...

793

drooling over her.

I'm sure you didn't mean any harm.

822

00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,021
Right.

898
00:58:02,101 --> 00:58:05,621
WILLIAM:- Right. Thanks. That's very helpful.

899
00:58:07,341 --> 00:58:10,781
MAX:You didn't know
she had a boyfriend?

900
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:13,261
WILLIAM:No. No.

901
00:58:13,341 --> 00:58:15,181
WILLIAM:Why? Did you?

902
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,741
WILLIAM:[ William ] Oh, bloody hell.
I don't believe it.

903
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:22,821
WILLIAM:My whole life ruined because
I don't read Hello magazine.

904
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:26,541
MAX:Let's face facts.
This was always a no-win situation.

905
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:30,382
MAX:Anna's... a goddess.

906
00:58:30,462 --> 00:58:33,382
MAX:You know what happens to mortals
who get involved with the gods.

907
00:58:33,462 --> 00:58:36,142
WILLIAM:- Buggered, is it?
MAX:- Every time.

908
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:40,902
MAX:But don't despair. I think I have
the solution to your problems.

909
00:58:40,982 --> 00:58:43,582
WILLIAM:- Really?
MAX:- Mm-hmm. Her name is Tessa.

910
00:58:43,662 --> 00:58:45,462
MAX:She works in the Contracts Department.

911
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:48,662
MAX:The hair, I admit,
is unfashionably frizzy,

912
00:58:48,742 --> 00:58:52,582
MAX:but she's bright as a button and kisses
like a nymphomaniac on death row.

913
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,822
MAX:- Apparently.

915
00:58:57,262 --> 00:58:59,783
MAX:Now... try.

916
00:59:02,743 --> 00:59:04,823
TESSA (V.O.):[ Tessa ]
I got completely lost.

917
00:59:04,863 --> 00:59:07,463
TESSA (V.O.):It's very difficult, isn't it?
Everything's got the word
"Kensington" in it.

918
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:10,783
TESSA (V.O.):Kensington Park Road. Kensington Garden.
Kensington bloody Park Garden.

919
00:59:10,823 --> 00:59:13,263
MAX:- Tessa, this is Bella, my wife.
TESSA:- Hello.

920
00:59:13,343 --> 00:59:15,343
TESSA:- You're in a wheelchair.
BELLA:- That's right.

921
00:59:15,423 --> 00:59:17,743
MAX:And this is William.

922
00:59:17,823 --> 00:59:20,023
TESSA:- Hello, William.
- Hi.

923
00:59:20,103 --> 00:59:23,063
TESSA:- Max has told me everything about you.
WILLIAM:- Has he?

924
00:59:23,103 --> 00:59:25,623
Oh, yes.
You are a naughty boy.

925
00:59:25,703 --> 00:59:27,944
MAX:- Wine?
TESSA:- Oh, yes, please.

926
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:29,944
TESSA:Come on, Willie.
Let's get sloshed.

927
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,984
- Red or white?
- Red.

928
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:36,824
MAX:Keziah.

929
00:59:38,264 --> 00:59:41,384
MAX:- Some woodcock?
KEZIAH:- No, thank you. I'm a fruitarian.

930
00:59:41,464 --> 00:59:43,744
Ah.

931
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:47,864
WILLIAM:What is a fruitarian, exactly?

932
00:59:47,944 --> 00:59:51,624
KEZIAH:We believe that
fruits and vegetables have feelings,

933
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:53,904
KEZIAH:so we think cooking is cruel.

934
00:59:53,984 --> 00:59:57,785
KEZIAH:We only eat things that have actually
fallen from the tree or bush,

935
00:59:57,865 --> 00:59:59,985
KEZIAH:that are, in fact, dead already.

936
01:00:01,705 --> 01:00:05,785
WILLIAM:Ah. Oh, right.

937
01:00:05,865 --> 01:00:07,745
WILLIAM:Right.

938
01:00:07,785 --> 01:00:09,905
WILLIAM:So, um, these carrots?

939
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:12,505
KEZIAH:- Have been murdered, yes.
WILLIAM:- Murdered.

940
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:16,985
WILLIAM:Poor old carrots.
That's--

941
01:00:17,025 --> 01:00:18,905
WILLIAM:That's beastly.

942
01:00:22,145 --> 01:00:25,106
ROSIE:Delicious coffee.

943
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:27,586
MAX:- I'm sorry about the lamb.

944
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:32,226
ROSIE:No. I thought it was...
really, you know, interesting.

945
01:00:32,306 --> 01:00:35,226
WILLIAM:Interesting means inedible.

946
01:00:35,306 --> 01:00:38,626
ROSIE:- Really inedible. Yes, you're right.

947
01:00:41,226 --> 01:00:44,826
ROSIE:Well, maybe we'll meet again.

948
01:00:44,906 --> 01:00:48,466
WILLIAM:Yeah, yeah.
That would be, uh--

949
01:00:48,546 --> 01:00:50,386
WILLIAM:be great.

950
01:00:57,627 --> 01:00:59,467
Bye.

951
01:01:17,787 --> 01:01:20,187
Well?

952
01:01:20,227 --> 01:01:22,108
WILLIAM:Perfect.

953
01:01:22,148 --> 01:01:24,268
WILLIAM:Absolutely perfect.

954
01:01:26,628 --> 01:01:29,388
BELLA:And?

955
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:33,068
WILLIAM:I think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.

956
01:01:35,148 --> 01:01:39,428
WILLIAM:To find someone you actually... love,
who'll love you.

957
01:01:39,468 --> 01:01:42,228
WILLIAM:The chances are always minuscule.

958
01:01:43,628 --> 01:01:45,508
WILLIAM:Look at me.

959
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:49,948
WILLIAM:Apart from the American, I've only
loved two girls, both total disasters.

960
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:51,989
MAX:- That's not fair.
- One of them marries me,
then leaves me...

961
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:54,949
WILLIAM:faster than you can say
"Indiana Jones".

962
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:58,309
WILLIAM:And the other-- who seriously
ought to have known better--

963
01:01:58,389 --> 01:02:00,309
WILLIAM:casually marries my best friend.

964
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:04,349
BELLA:- She still loves you, though.
WILLIAM:- In a depressingly asexual way.

965
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,509
BELLA:- I never fancied you much, actually.

966
01:02:08,589 --> 01:02:12,029
BELLA:- Oh, God.

967
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:15,589
BELLA:I loved you.
You were terribly funny, but...

968
01:02:15,669 --> 01:02:17,869
BELLA:all that kissing my ears.

969
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:20,510
WILLIAM:I don't believe it.
This is just getting worse.

970
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,150
WILLIAM:I shall find myself 30 years from now
still sitting on this sofa.

971
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:28,270
BELLA:- Do you wanna stay?
WILLIAM:- Yeah. Why not?

972
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,990
WILLIAM:All that awaits me at home
is a masturbating Welshman.

973
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,910
Here we go.

974
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,830
- Good night.
- Night.

976
01:02:57,151 --> 01:02:59,111
- See you.
- Right.

977
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:09,391
Guilty.
Very, very guilty.

978
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:11,311
So it seems.

981
01:03:56,873 --> 01:03:59,353
ANNA:Hi.

982
01:04:00,913 --> 01:04:03,073
ANNA:Can I come in?

983
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:04,993
WILLIAM:Come in.

984
01:04:11,953 --> 01:04:14,954
ANNA:They were taken years ago.

985
01:04:15,034 --> 01:04:17,834
ANNA:I know it was--

986
01:04:17,914 --> 01:04:22,354
ANNA:But I was poor and--
it happens a lot.

987
01:04:22,434 --> 01:04:24,714
ANNA:That's not an excuse.
I just--

988
01:04:27,234 --> 01:04:30,274
ANNA:But to make matters worse,

989
01:04:30,354 --> 01:04:33,434
ANNA:it now appears as though...

990
01:04:33,514 --> 01:04:37,354
ANNA:someone was filming me as well.

991
01:04:37,434 --> 01:04:41,034
ANNA:So what was a stupid
photo shoot...

992
01:04:41,074 --> 01:04:43,275
ANNA:now looks like a porn film.

993
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,635
ANNA:The pictures have been sold
and they're just...

994
01:04:48,715 --> 01:04:50,555
ANNA:everywhere.

995
01:04:53,715 --> 01:04:55,915
ANNA:I didn't know where to go.

996
01:04:58,315 --> 01:05:00,155
ANNA:The hotel's surrounded.

997
01:05:04,235 --> 01:05:07,395
I know it's been months, but--

998
01:05:07,475 --> 01:05:09,715
WILLIAM:This is the place.

999
01:05:11,996 --> 01:05:14,156
ANNA:Thank you.

1000
01:05:17,236 --> 01:05:19,596
ANNA:I'm just in London...

1001
01:05:19,636 --> 01:05:22,396
ANNA:for two days,
but what with your papers,

1002
01:05:22,476 --> 01:05:25,276
ANNA:it's the worst place to be.
[ Sniffling ]

1003
01:05:25,356 --> 01:05:29,036
ANNA:These pictures are just so horrible,
and they're so grainy.

1004
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:30,956
ANNA:It makes me look like--

1005
01:05:31,036 --> 01:05:32,996
WILLIAM:Don't think about it.

1006
01:05:35,236 --> 01:05:37,396
WILLIAM:We'll sort it out.

1007
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:44,397
WILLIAM:What would you like?
Tea?

1008
01:05:44,477 --> 01:05:46,317
WILLIAM:Bath?

1009
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:53,277
ANNA:- A bath would be great.

1010
01:05:55,317 --> 01:05:57,197
SPIKE:Oh, Christ alive!

1011
01:06:01,677 --> 01:06:03,957
SPIKE:Brilliant. Fantastic.

1012
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:09,358
SPIKE:Magnificent.

1013
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,478
ANNA:You must be Spike.

1015
01:06:30,598 --> 01:06:33,958
ANNA:- Hi.
SPIKE:- Just...

1016
01:06:34,038 --> 01:06:35,919
SPIKE:checkin'.

1017
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:42,359
SPIKE:Thank you, God.

1018
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:48,439
ANNA:I'm really sorry about last time.

1019
01:06:48,519 --> 01:06:50,799
ANNA:- Oh--
ANNA:- He just flew in.

1020
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,719
ANNA:- I had no idea.
- All right.

1021
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:57,199
ANNA:In fact, I had no idea
if he was ever gonna fly in again.

1022
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:00,239
WILLIAM:It's not often one
has the opportunity to adios...

1023
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:03,079
WILLIAM:the plates of
a major Hollywood film star.

1024
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,560
WILLIAM:It was, um--
it was thrilling for me.

1025
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,960
WILLIAM:So how is he?

1026
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,840
ANNA:I don't know.

1027
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,400
ANNA:It just got to the point...

1028
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,760
ANNA:where I couldn't remember
any of the reasons why we were together.

1029
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,880
ANNA:And you and love?

1030
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,400
WILLIAM:Oh, well, there's a question, um,

1031
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,881
WILLIAM:without an interesting answer.

1032
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:39,721
ANNA:I have thought about you.

1033
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:44,681
WILLIAM:- Oh.
ANNA:WILLIAM:- It's just that...

1034
01:07:44,721 --> 01:07:48,121
ANNA:anytime I've tried to keep...

1035
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:51,881
ANNA:anything normal
with a person that was...

1036
01:07:51,961 --> 01:07:54,041
ANNA:normal,
it's just been a disaster.

1037
01:07:54,121 --> 01:07:58,281
WILLIAM:Listen, I appreciate that.
Absolutely.

1038
01:07:58,361 --> 01:08:01,202
WILLIAM:So what is that,
a film you're doing?

1039
01:08:01,282 --> 01:08:05,242
ANNA:Um, start in L.A. on Tuesday.

1040
01:08:05,322 --> 01:08:08,202
WILLIAM:Would you like me to
take you through your lines?

1041
01:08:08,282 --> 01:08:11,282
ANNA:Would you?
'Cause it's all talk, talk, talk.

1042
01:08:11,362 --> 01:08:13,442
WILLIAM:Hand it over.

1043
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:18,202
WILLIAM:Right.
Um, basic plot?

1044
01:08:18,282 --> 01:08:21,162
ANNA:I'm a difficult but brilliant
junior officer...

1045
01:08:21,242 --> 01:08:25,962
ANNA:who in about 20 minutes is gonna
save the world from nuclear disaster.

1046
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:28,202
WILLIAM:Mm-hmm. Okay.
Well done, you.

1047
01:08:28,282 --> 01:08:30,443
WILLIAM:"Message from Command. Would you
like them to send in the H.K.s?"

1048
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:33,403
ANNA:WILLIAM:No. Turn over four T.R.S.s
and tell them we need radar feedback...

1049
01:08:33,483 --> 01:08:35,323
ANNA:before the K.F.T.s return at 1900.

1050
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:38,883
ANNA:Then inform the Pentagon we'll need
Black Star cover from 1000 through 1215.

1051
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:42,763
ANNA:And if you say one word about how many
mistakes I made in that speech,
I'll pelt you with olives.

1052
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:45,323
WILLIAM:- Very well, Captain.
I'll pass that on straightaway.
- Thank you.

1053
01:08:45,363 --> 01:08:47,243
ANNA:- How many mistakes did I make?
WILLIAM:- Eleven.

1054
01:08:47,283 --> 01:08:51,403
ANNA:- Damn it. And Wainwright--
WILLIAM:- Cartwright.

1055
01:08:51,483 --> 01:08:53,563
ANNA:Cartwright, Wainwright,
whatever your name is,

1056
01:08:53,643 --> 01:08:55,483
ANNA:I promised little Jimmy
I'd be home for his birthday,

1057
01:08:55,563 --> 01:08:57,963
ANNA:so could you get a message to him
that I may be late.

1058
01:08:58,043 --> 01:09:00,124
WILLIAM:Certainly.
And, uh, little Johnny?

1059
01:09:00,204 --> 01:09:02,484
ANNA:- My son's name is Johnny?
WILLIAM:- Yep.

1060
01:09:02,564 --> 01:09:05,164
ANNA:- Then get a message to him too.
- I'll do what I can, Captain,

1061
01:09:05,204 --> 01:09:07,084
but I can't promise anything.

1062
01:09:07,124 --> 01:09:11,644
- And Cartwright goes.

1063
01:09:11,724 --> 01:09:15,684
ANNA:- What do you think?
WILLIAM:- Gripping. It's not Jane Austen.

1064
01:09:15,764 --> 01:09:18,604
WILLIAM:It's not Henry James,
but it's... gripping.

1065
01:09:18,644 --> 01:09:22,284
ANNA:- Think I should do Henry James instead?
WILLIAM:- You would be brilliant.

1066
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:27,485
WILLIAM:But this writer-- writers--
they're pretty damn good too.

1067
01:09:27,565 --> 01:09:30,045
ANNA:You never get anyone
on Wings of the Dove saying,

1068
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:32,805
ANNA:"inform the Pentagon
we need Black Star cover."

1069
01:09:32,885 --> 01:09:34,725
WILLIAM:For me the book is the poorer for it.

1070
01:09:39,765 --> 01:09:42,125
ANNA:I can't believe you have that picture.

1071
01:09:43,605 --> 01:09:45,965
WILLIAM:ANNA:You like Chagall?

1072
01:09:46,045 --> 01:09:50,525
ANNA:I do. It feels like
how love should be--

1073
01:09:50,605 --> 01:09:53,205
ANNA:floating through a dark blue sky.

1074
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:55,886
WILLIAM:With a goat, playing a violin.

1075
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:57,806
ANNA:Well, yes.

1076
01:09:57,846 --> 01:10:00,846
ANNA:Happiness isn't happiness
without a violin-playing goat.

1077
01:10:21,086 --> 01:10:22,926
SPIKE:You have big feet.

1078
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:29,487
WILLIAM:Yes.
Yes, always have had.

1079
01:10:31,247 --> 01:10:34,687
ANNA:You know what they say
about men with big feet.

1080
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:37,887
WILLIAM:No.
What's that?

1081
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:41,487
ANNA:Uh, big feet,

1082
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:44,127
ANNA:large... shoes.

1083
01:10:49,727 --> 01:10:51,567
ANNA:The thing that is so irritating...

1084
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,888
ANNA:is that now I'm so fierce
when it comes to nudity clauses.

1085
01:10:54,928 --> 01:10:57,568
WILLIAM:You actually have... clauses
in your contract about nudity?

1086
01:10:57,608 --> 01:10:59,488
ANNA:Definitely.

1087
01:10:59,528 --> 01:11:03,008
ANNA:"You may show the dent of the top of the
artist's buttocks, but neither cheek."

1088
01:11:03,048 --> 01:11:06,168
ANNA:Or if there's
a stunt bottom being used...

1089
01:11:06,248 --> 01:11:09,088
ANNA:"artist must have full consultation."

1090
01:11:09,128 --> 01:11:14,128
WILLIAM:- You have a stunt bottom?
ANNA:- I could have a stunt bottom, yes.

1091
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:18,448
WILLIAM:Are people tempted to go
for better bottoms than their own?

1092
01:11:18,528 --> 01:11:21,048
ANNA:Yeah. [ Chuckling ] I would.
This is important stuff.

1093
01:11:21,129 --> 01:11:24,929
WILLIAM:It's one hell of a job, isn't it?
What do you put on your passport?

1094
01:11:25,009 --> 01:11:27,329
WILLIAM:"Profession: Mel Gibson's bottom."
[ Chuckling ]

1095
01:11:27,369 --> 01:11:29,489
ANNA:Actually, Mel does his own ass work.

1096
01:11:29,569 --> 01:11:31,449
- Right.
ANNA:- Why wouldn't he?

1097
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:35,449
- Absolutely.
ANNA:- It's delicious.

1098
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:38,729
WILLIAM:What, the ice cream
or Mel Gibson's bottom?

1099
01:11:38,769 --> 01:11:41,529
ANNA:Both. Equally.

1100
01:11:41,609 --> 01:11:44,129
But you wouldn't necessarily lick both?

1101
01:11:44,169 --> 01:11:48,329
- Well, this is tart. [ Laughing ]

1102
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:50,530
And fuzz-free.

1103
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,930
And, uh--

1104
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:59,570
Bedroom.
There's clean sheets.

1105
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:11,570
ANNA:Today's been a good day,

1106
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:14,450
ANNA:which in the circumstances is...

1107
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,210
ANNA:unexpected.

1108
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:19,451
WILLIAM:Thank you.

1109
01:12:22,891 --> 01:12:25,851
WILLIAM:Anyway, um,

1110
01:12:25,931 --> 01:12:27,811
WILLIAM:time for bed.

1111
01:12:28,931 --> 01:12:30,771
WILLIAM:Or sofa bed.

1112
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:38,500
ANNA:Good night.

1113
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,731
Good night.

1117
01:13:24,493 --> 01:13:26,333
WILLIAM:Oh, my God.

1118
01:13:34,133 --> 01:13:36,493
WILLIAM:Hello?

1119
01:13:36,533 --> 01:13:38,413
SPIKE:Hello.

1120
01:13:40,053 --> 01:13:43,493
- Spike.
SPIKE:- I wonder if I could have a little word.

1121
01:13:43,573 --> 01:13:46,774
- Right.
SPIKE:- I don't want to interfere or anything,

1122
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:49,414
SPIKE:but she's just split up
from her boyfriend, right?

1123
01:13:49,454 --> 01:13:53,134
WILLIAM:- Maybe.
SPIKE:- And she's in your house.

1124
01:13:54,574 --> 01:13:57,894
WILLIAM:- Yes.
SPIKE:- And you get on very well.

1125
01:13:59,534 --> 01:14:02,174
WILLIAM:- Yes.
SPIKE:- Well, isn't this, perhaps,

1126
01:14:02,254 --> 01:14:04,214
SPIKE:a nice opportunity to...

1127
01:14:07,854 --> 01:14:09,694
SPIKE:slip her one.

1128
01:14:09,774 --> 01:14:11,654
WILLIAM:Spike, for God's sakes.
She's in trouble. Get a grip.

1129
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:14,255
SPIKE:You think it's the wrong moment.
Fair enough.

1130
01:14:19,215 --> 01:14:21,135
SPIKE:- Do you mind if I have a go?
WILLIAM:- Spike!

1131
01:14:21,175 --> 01:14:23,975
- Okay.
SPIKE:- I'll talk to you in the morning.

1132
01:14:24,015 --> 01:14:28,575
SPIKE:Okay.
Might be too late, but okay.

1136
01:14:37,975 --> 01:14:41,576
WILLIAM:[ Groans ]
Please, sod off.

1137
01:14:41,616 --> 01:14:43,496
ANNA:- Okay. All right.
WILLIAM:- No. No, no!

1138
01:14:43,536 --> 01:14:47,216
WILLIAM:Wait! I thought you were,
um, someone else.

1139
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:52,496
WILLIAM:I thought you were Spike.
I'm thrilled that you're not.

1140
01:15:51,538 --> 01:15:53,378
WILLIAM:Wow.

1141
01:15:55,578 --> 01:15:57,458
ANNA:What?

1142
01:15:57,498 --> 01:15:59,378
WILLIAM:Nothing.

1143
01:16:33,059 --> 01:16:35,660
WILLIAM:It does strike me as,

1144
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:39,300
WILLIAM:well, surreal that I'm allowed
to see you naked.

1145
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,220
ANNA:- You and every person in this country.
WILLIAM:- I'm sorry.

1146
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,220
ANNA:What is it about men and nudity, huh?

1147
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,180
ANNA:Particularly breasts.

1148
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:52,740
ANNA:- How can you be so interested in them?
WILLIAM:- Well--

1149
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,260
ANNA:But, seriously,
they're just breasts.

1150
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:58,060
ANNA:Every second person
in the world has them.

1151
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:01,700
WILLIAM:More than that, when you think about it.
Meat Loaf has a very nice pair.

1152
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:05,101
ANNA:[ Chuckling ]
But they're odd-looking.

1153
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:07,861
ANNA:They're for milk.
Your mother has them.

1154
01:17:07,901 --> 01:17:11,301
ANNA:You've seen a thousand of them.
What's all the fuss about?

1155
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:14,501
WILLIAM:Actually, I can't think
what it is, really.

1156
01:17:14,581 --> 01:17:17,061
WILLIAM:Let me just have a quick look.

1157
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:24,381
WILLIAM:- Nope, nope. Beats me.

1158
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:30,741
ANNA:Rita Hayworth used to say,

1159
01:17:30,821 --> 01:17:34,422
ANNA:"They go to bed with Gilda,
they wake up with me."

1160
01:17:34,462 --> 01:17:39,382
WILLIAM:ANNA:- Who was Gilda?
ANNA:- Her most famous part.

1161
01:17:39,462 --> 01:17:42,302
ANNA:Men went to bed with the dream,

1162
01:17:42,382 --> 01:17:45,902
ANNA:and they didn't like it
when they woke up with the reality.

1163
01:17:47,382 --> 01:17:49,262
ANNA:Do you feel that way?

1164
01:17:51,862 --> 01:17:55,422
WILLIAM:You are lovelier this morning
than you have ever been.

1165
01:17:58,982 --> 01:18:00,822
ANNA:I'll be right back.

1166
01:18:13,903 --> 01:18:15,743
ANNA:Breakfast in bed.

1167
01:18:15,823 --> 01:18:20,023
ANNA:- Oh.
ANNA:- Or it's brunch or lunch or something.

1168
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:22,703
My God.

1169
01:18:22,743 --> 01:18:24,623
ANNA:Can I stay a bit longer?

1170
01:18:27,263 --> 01:18:29,143
WILLIAM:Stay forever.

1171
01:18:31,544 --> 01:18:33,744
ANNA:Okay.
Oh. Forgot the jam.

1173
01:18:37,904 --> 01:18:40,184
ANNA:I'll get the jam,
you get the door.

1175
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:57,144
WILLIAM:Jesus Christ.

1176
01:18:59,785 --> 01:19:02,105
ANNA:What?

1177
01:19:02,185 --> 01:19:04,385
WILLIAM:What is it?

1178
01:19:04,465 --> 01:19:07,305
- Nothing, really.
ANNA:- You're up to something.

1179
01:19:07,385 --> 01:19:10,145
ANNA:- Anna, no, please!

1180
01:19:12,585 --> 01:19:17,185
ANNA:My God. And they got a picture of you
dressed like that.

1181
01:19:17,265 --> 01:19:18,945
Yes.

1182
01:19:20,745 --> 01:19:22,585
WILLIAM:Undressed like this, yeah.

1183
01:19:24,345 --> 01:19:27,826
SPIKE:- Morning, darling ones.
ANNA:- It's me. The press are here.

1184
01:19:27,906 --> 01:19:30,026
ANNA:No, there are hundreds of them.

1185
01:19:30,106 --> 01:19:32,626
ANNA:My brilliant plan
was not so brilliant. I know.

1186
01:19:32,706 --> 01:19:35,866
ANNA:I know. I know.
Just get over here.

1187
01:19:35,946 --> 01:19:37,786
ANNA:Damn it.

1188
01:19:42,746 --> 01:19:45,666
WILLIAM:ANNA:- Um, I wouldn't go outside.
SPIKE:- Why not?

1189
01:19:48,226 --> 01:19:50,786
WILLIAM:- Just take my word for it.
SPIKE:- Oh.

1191
01:20:12,427 --> 01:20:14,507
SPIKE:SPIKE:How did I look?
Not bad.

1192
01:20:14,587 --> 01:20:18,427
SPIKE:Not at all bad.
Well-chosen briefs, I'd say.

1193
01:20:18,507 --> 01:20:21,067
SPIKE:Chicks love gray.

1194
01:20:21,147 --> 01:20:23,708
SPIKE:Nice firm buttocks.

1195
01:20:27,508 --> 01:20:29,388
WILLIAM:How are you doing?

1196
01:20:29,428 --> 01:20:31,908
ANNA:How do you think I'm doing?

1197
01:20:33,268 --> 01:20:35,428
WILLIAM:- I don't know what happened.
ANNA:- I do.

1198
01:20:35,508 --> 01:20:40,268
ANNA:Your furry friend thought he'd make
a buck telling the papers where I was.

1199
01:20:40,308 --> 01:20:42,188
WILLIAM:- That's not true.
ANNA:- Really?

1200
01:20:42,228 --> 01:20:45,428
ANNA:The entire British press
got up this morning and thought,
"I know where Anna Scott is.

1201
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:48,308
ANNA:She's in that house with the blue door
in Notting Hill."

1202
01:20:48,388 --> 01:20:51,028
ANNA:Then you go out
in your goddamn underwear!

1203
01:20:51,108 --> 01:20:53,949
SPIKE:- I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
WILLIAM:- Get out!

1204
01:20:54,029 --> 01:20:56,029
Sorry.

1205
01:20:56,109 --> 01:20:59,749
WILLIAM:- I'm so sorry.
ANNA:- This is such an unbelievable mess.

1206
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:02,629
ANNA:I come to you to protect myself
against more crappy gossip,

1207
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:04,549
ANNA:and now I've landed in it
all over again.

1208
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:07,349
ANNA:For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend!

1209
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,989
WILLIAM:- You have?
ANNA:WILLIAM:- As far as they're concerned I do.

1210
01:21:11,069 --> 01:21:15,749
ANNA:And now, tomorrow there'll be
pictures of you in every newspaper
from here to Timbuktu!

1211
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:18,669
WILLIAM:I know that, but...
just let's stay calm.

1212
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:22,310
ANNA:You stay calm! This is a perfect
situation for you, isn't it?

1213
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:24,670
ANNA:Minimum input, maximum publicity.

1214
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,230
ANNA:Everywhere you go, people will say,
"Well done, you.

1215
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:30,950
ANNA:You slept with that actress.
We saw the pictures."

1216
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:33,670
WILLIAM:- That is spectacularly unfair.
ANNA:- That's yours.

1217
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:35,590
ANNA:Maybe it'll even help business.

1218
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:38,150
ANNA:Buy a boring book about Egypt
from the guy that screwed Anna Scott.

1219
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:41,830
WILLIAM:Stop! Stop! I beg you!

1220
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:44,070
WILLIAM:Calm down.
How about a cup of tea?

1221
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:46,110
ANNA:I don't want
a goddamn cup of tea.

1222
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,031
ANNA:- I just wanna go home.

1223
01:21:50,111 --> 01:21:52,751
WILLIAM:Spike, see who that is,
and put some clothes on, for God's sake.

1224
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:55,391
SPIKE:- Looks like a chauffeur to me.

1225
01:21:55,471 --> 01:21:57,791
ANNA:Spike owes you
an expensive dinner or holiday,

1226
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:00,751
ANNA:depending who's got the brains
to get the going rate on betrayal.

1227
01:22:00,831 --> 01:22:02,671
WILLIAM:That is not true.
Wait a minute.

1228
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,351
WILLIAM:This is crazy behavior.

1229
01:22:05,391 --> 01:22:08,551
WILLIAM:Can't we just
laugh about all this?

1230
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:12,191
WILLIAM:Seriously. In the huge sweep of things,
this stuff doesn't matter.

1231
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:15,311
SPIKE:What he's gonna say next is
there's people starving in the Sudan.

1232
01:22:15,391 --> 01:22:18,992
WILLIAM:Well, there are, and we don't
have to go anywhere near that far.

1233
01:22:19,072 --> 01:22:21,872
WILLIAM:My best friend slipped down stairs,
cracked her back...

1234
01:22:21,952 --> 01:22:24,392
WILLIAM:and she's in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life.

1235
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:28,672
WILLIAM:All I'm asking for is
a normal amount of perspective.

1236
01:22:28,752 --> 01:22:31,112
ANNA:You're right.
Of course, you're right.

1237
01:22:31,192 --> 01:22:33,872
ANNA:It's just that I've dealt
with this garbage for ten years.

1238
01:22:33,952 --> 01:22:35,792
ANNA:You've had it for ten minutes.

1239
01:22:35,872 --> 01:22:39,192
ANNA:Our perspectives are very different.

1240
01:22:39,272 --> 01:22:42,632
WILLIAM:Today's newspapers will be lining
tomorrow's wastepaper bin.

1241
01:22:42,712 --> 01:22:44,752
ANNA:- Excuse me?
WILLIAM:- You know.

1242
01:22:44,832 --> 01:22:46,953
WILLIAM:It's just one day.

1243
01:22:46,993 --> 01:22:50,473
ANNA:WILLIAM:Tomorrow, today's papers
will all have been thrown out.

1244
01:22:50,513 --> 01:22:52,593
ANNA:You really don't get it.

1245
01:22:52,673 --> 01:22:54,993
ANNA:This story will be filed.

1246
01:22:55,073 --> 01:22:59,753
ANNA:Every time anyone writes anything
about me, they'll dig up these photos.

1247
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:01,753
ANNA:Newspapers last forever.

1248
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:04,553
ANNA:I'll regret this forever.

1249
01:23:06,593 --> 01:23:08,433
WILLIAM:Right.

1250
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,873
Right.

1251
01:23:13,953 --> 01:23:16,114
WILLIAM:I will feel the opposite,

1252
01:23:16,194 --> 01:23:20,154
WILLIAM:if that's okay by you, and, uh,

1253
01:23:20,234 --> 01:23:23,074
WILLIAM:always be glad that you...
came to stay.

1254
01:23:25,554 --> 01:23:28,314
WILLIAM:But, um, you're probably right.

1255
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:30,234
WILLIAM:You better go.

1258
01:24:09,275 --> 01:24:11,435
WILLIAM:Was it you?

1259
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:18,316
SPIKE:I may have told a few people
down at the pub.

1260
01:24:20,036 --> 01:24:21,876
WILLIAM:Right.

1282
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,680
HONEY:Have I got something for you. Something
which will make you love me so much,

1283
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,960
HONEY:you will want to hug me every day
for the rest of my life.

1284
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,840
WILLIAM:- Blimey. What is it?

1285
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,000
HONEY:Phone number of Anna Scott's agent
in London...

1286
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,480
HONEY:and her agent in New York.

1287
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,480
HONEY:Listen, you think about her all
the time. Now you can ring her.

1288
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,920
Yeah. Brilliant. Thanks.

1289
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,881
HONEY:I'll see you tonight.
Hey, Marty. Ooh! Sexy cardi.

1291
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:04,082
BELLA:Shh! Hello!
I have a little speech to make.

1292
01:27:04,122 --> 01:27:08,842
BELLA:I won't stand up because
I can't... be bothered.

1293
01:27:08,922 --> 01:27:13,482
BELLA:Exactly a year ago today, this man here
started the finest restaurant in London.

1294
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:15,402
- Hear, hear.
TONY:- Thank you very much.

1295
01:27:15,482 --> 01:27:17,922
BELLA:Unfortunately,
no one ever came to eat here.

1296
01:27:18,002 --> 01:27:20,722
TONY:- It's a tiny hiccup.

1297
01:27:20,762 --> 01:27:23,962
BELLA:And so we have to face the fact
that from next week,

1298
01:27:24,002 --> 01:27:25,882
BELLA:we must find somewhere new to eat.

1299
01:27:27,162 --> 01:27:31,322
BELLA:I just want to say to Tony...
don't take it personally.

1300
01:27:31,402 --> 01:27:35,083
BELLA:The more I think about things, the more
I see no rhyme or reason in life.

1301
01:27:35,163 --> 01:27:38,683
BELLA:No one knows why some things work out
and some things don't.

1302
01:27:38,723 --> 01:27:40,483
BELLA:Why some of us get lucky...

1303
01:27:40,563 --> 01:27:43,603
BELLA:- and some of us--
BERNIE:- Get fired.

1304
01:27:43,643 --> 01:27:44,923
- What?
BELLA:- No!

1305
01:27:45,003 --> 01:27:47,643
BERNIE:Yeah, well, it seems
they're shifting the whole outfit...

1306
01:27:47,723 --> 01:27:50,203
BERNIE:much more towards
the emerging markets.

1307
01:27:50,283 --> 01:27:54,723
TONY:BERNIE:And, of course, well,
I was total crap, so--

1308
01:27:54,803 --> 01:27:56,963
TONY:A toast to Bernie-- the worst
stockbroker in the whole world.

1309
01:27:57,043 --> 01:27:59,643
I thank you.
And Tony, the worst restauranteur.

1310
01:27:59,723 --> 01:28:02,204
- Tony and Bernie. Both crap...
- The terrible two.

1311
01:28:02,284 --> 01:28:04,804
in their own special ways.

1313
01:28:07,484 --> 01:28:09,804
HONEY:Since it's an evening
of announcements,

1314
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:13,124
HONEY:uh, I've also got one.

1315
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:16,284
HONEY:Um, I've decided to get engaged.

1316
01:28:16,364 --> 01:28:21,564
HONEY:I've found myself a nice,
slightly odd-looking bloke...

1317
01:28:21,604 --> 01:28:24,724
HONEY:who I know is gonna make me happy
for the rest of my life.

1318
01:28:26,324 --> 01:28:28,884
WILLIAM:Wait a sec. I mean, I--

1319
01:28:28,924 --> 01:28:32,805
MAX:WILLIAM:I'm your brother. I don't know
anything about this. Is he--

1320
01:28:32,885 --> 01:28:36,285
HONEY:MAX:- Is he financially viable?

1321
01:28:36,365 --> 01:28:38,925
HONEY:He's an artist...
with brilliant prospects.

1322
01:28:41,405 --> 01:28:44,405
HONEY:HONEY:- This is a secret
you've been keeping from me.
- [ Bella ] No, I swear!

1323
01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:46,405
HONEY:[ Whispering ]
By the way, it's you.

1324
01:28:49,605 --> 01:28:52,685
SPIKE:- Me?
HONEY:- What do you think?

1325
01:28:54,445 --> 01:28:56,285
SPIKE:Well, yeah.

1326
01:28:58,286 --> 01:29:00,526
SPIKE:Groovy.

1327
01:29:00,606 --> 01:29:04,646
MAX:Excuse me.
Are there any more announcements?

1328
01:29:04,726 --> 01:29:07,126
WILLIAM:Well, actually, yes.

1329
01:29:07,206 --> 01:29:10,046
WILLIAM:I feel I should
apologize to everyone...

1330
01:29:10,086 --> 01:29:12,406
WILLIAM:for my behavior
over the last six months.

1331
01:29:12,446 --> 01:29:15,966
WILLIAM:I have, as you know,
been somewhat down in the mouth.

1332
01:29:16,006 --> 01:29:19,446
MAX:There's an understatement.
There are dead people on better form.

1333
01:29:19,486 --> 01:29:23,086
WILLIAM:But I just wish to make it clear
that I've turned a corner,

1334
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:27,087
WILLIAM:and, um, henceforward intend
to be impressively happy.

1336
01:29:32,807 --> 01:29:36,567
BELLA:# Without a love of my own #

1337
01:29:40,407 --> 01:29:44,487
- # Blue moon #
- # Ba-boom, ba-boom #

1338
01:29:44,567 --> 01:29:47,847
# You knew just what I was there for #

1339
01:29:47,927 --> 01:29:50,687
BELLA:Oh, God. I'm horribly drunk.

1340
01:29:50,767 --> 01:29:53,727
MAX:# You heard me saying a prayer for #

1341
01:29:53,807 --> 01:29:55,768
MAX:- Come here.
- # Ba-boom, ba-boom #

1342
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:58,928
# Someone I really could care for #

1343
01:29:59,008 --> 01:30:03,168
MAX:- So you've laid the ghost?
- # Wah, wah, wah, wah #

1344
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:05,048
WILLIAM:I believe I have.

1345
01:30:05,088 --> 01:30:08,328
MAX:Don't give a damn
about the famous girl?

1346
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:10,128
WILLIAM:No.

1347
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:12,888
WILLIAM:No, I don't think I do.

1348
01:30:12,928 --> 01:30:15,728
MAX:Which means you won't be distracted
by the fact that she's back in London...

1349
01:30:15,808 --> 01:30:17,408
MAX:grasping her Oscar...

1350
01:30:17,448 --> 01:30:20,368
MAX:and currently to be found filming,
most days, on Hampstead Heath.

1351
01:30:22,128 --> 01:30:23,969
WILLIAM:Oh, God, no.

1352
01:30:27,129 --> 01:30:29,809
MAX:So not over her, in fact.

1354
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:14,370
SECURITY:- Can I help you?
WILLIAM:- Yeah, I'm, um--

1355
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:16,730
WILLIAM:- I'm looking for Anna Scott.
SECURITY:- Does she know you're coming?

1356
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:20,130
WILLIAM:No. No, uh, she doesn't.

1357
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:23,371
SECURITY:- I'm afraid I can't let you through.
WILLIAM:- Right.

1358
01:31:23,451 --> 01:31:28,251
WILLIAM:I mean, I am actually a friend.
I'm not a lunatic, but--

1359
01:31:28,291 --> 01:31:31,051
WILLIAM:- No, you basically, er--
SECURITY:- Can't let you through, sir.

1360
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:12,692
ANNA:Well, this is, uh--

1361
01:32:12,772 --> 01:32:15,972
WILLIAM:I only found out
you were here yesterday.

1362
01:32:16,052 --> 01:32:19,653
ANNA:- I was going to call, but I--
ANNA:- [ Woman ] Uh, Anna.

1363
01:32:19,733 --> 01:32:22,093
ANNA:Yes. Um--

1364
01:32:22,173 --> 01:32:24,493
ANNA:Things aren't going very well,
and it's our last day.

1365
01:32:24,573 --> 01:32:26,893
WILLIAM:Absolutely, yeah.
You're clearly very busy.

1366
01:32:26,973 --> 01:32:29,293
ANNA:But if-- if you could wait,

1367
01:32:29,373 --> 01:32:31,933
ANNA:there are... things to say.

1368
01:32:36,213 --> 01:32:38,053
WILLIAM:Okay.

1369
01:32:39,933 --> 01:32:42,693
ANNA:Drink tea.
There's lots of tea.

1370
01:32:48,894 --> 01:32:50,734
KAREN:Come and have a look.

1371
01:32:54,934 --> 01:32:57,974
KAREN:Are you a fan of Henry James?

1372
01:32:58,054 --> 01:33:00,654
WILLIAM:- This is a Henry James film?
- Yeah.

1373
01:33:07,614 --> 01:33:09,734
KAREN:This is, uh, Harry.

1374
01:33:09,814 --> 01:33:12,894
KAREN:He'll give you a pair of headphones
so you can hear the dialogue.

1375
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:14,815
HARRY:- Thank you very much.
HARRY:- No problem.

1376
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:17,415
- Hi.
HARRY:- Hi. Here we go.

1377
01:33:17,495 --> 01:33:20,855
WILLIAM:HARRY:- Volume's on the side. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1378
01:33:28,735 --> 01:33:32,055
JAMES:[ Man Through Headphones ]
We are living in cloud cuckoo land.
We'll never get this done today.

1379
01:33:32,135 --> 01:33:34,295
ANNA:[ Anna ] We've got to.
I have to be in New York on Thursday.

1380
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:38,375
JAMES:Oh, stop showing off.
God, that's an enormous ass.

1381
01:33:38,455 --> 01:33:42,495
ANNA:- I'm not listening.
JAMES:- But seriously, it's not fair.

1382
01:33:42,535 --> 01:33:44,776
JAMES:So many tragic young teenagers
with anorexia...

1383
01:33:44,856 --> 01:33:47,376
JAMES:and that girl has an ass
she could perfectly well share around...

1384
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:51,176
JAMES:with at least ten other women
and still be big-bottomed.

1385
01:33:51,256 --> 01:33:53,656
ANNA:I would think, looking at
something nice like that,

1386
01:33:53,736 --> 01:33:57,736
ANNA:you and your...
bony little excuse for an arse...

1387
01:33:57,816 --> 01:33:59,656
ANNA:would be well advised to keep quiet.

1388
01:33:59,736 --> 01:34:01,816
ANNA:Now down to business.
The end of the scene.

1389
01:34:01,896 --> 01:34:04,936
ANNA:Um, I ask you when you're
telling everyone, and you say--

1390
01:34:05,016 --> 01:34:09,016
JAMES:Um, tomorrow will be soon enough.

1391
01:34:09,096 --> 01:34:11,416
ANNA:And then I-- Right. Okay.

1392
01:34:11,496 --> 01:34:15,177
JAMES:Say, who was that rather diffident chap
I saw you talking to round the back?

1393
01:34:15,217 --> 01:34:17,097
ANNA:No one.

1394
01:34:18,417 --> 01:34:21,337
ANNA:Just some guy from the past. I--

1395
01:34:21,417 --> 01:34:25,177
WILLIAM:ANNA:it's a bit of an awkward situation.
I don't know what he's doing here.

1396
01:34:41,618 --> 01:34:43,458
'Course.

1397
01:34:48,978 --> 01:34:51,978
WILLIAM:Thanks. I've got to, um--

1398
01:34:52,018 --> 01:34:53,898
Any time.

1399
01:35:03,058 --> 01:35:06,378
[ Man ] Ladies and gentlemen,
can we have you on your first marks?

1400
01:35:06,418 --> 01:35:08,458
On your first marks!

1401
01:35:20,099 --> 01:35:23,299
MARTIN:Uh, l-I do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

1402
01:35:23,379 --> 01:35:26,419
MARTIN:but, uh, there's a delivery for you.

1403
01:35:26,499 --> 01:35:28,779
WILLIAM:Martin, really.
Can't you just do it yourself?

1404
01:35:28,819 --> 01:35:33,179
MARTIN:But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

1405
01:35:34,219 --> 01:35:35,739
WILLIAM:Right. Okay.

1406
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:40,300
WILLIAM:Tell me, if I employ a wet rag, would l
have to pay it as much as I pay you?

1407
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:47,020
ANNA:Hi.

1408
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,100
WILLIAM:Hello.

1409
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:51,220
ANNA:You disappeared.

1410
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:53,820
WILLIAM:Yeah. Yeah. Um--

1411
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:57,620
WILLIAM:I had to leave.
I didn't want to disturb.

1412
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:01,500
ANNA:WILLIAM:- How have you been?
WILLIAM:- Fine, fine. Everything much the same.

1413
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:05,500
WILLIAM:When they change the law,
Spike and I will marry immediately.

1414
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:08,501
WILLIAM:Whereas you, I've watched in wonder.

1415
01:36:08,581 --> 01:36:10,701
WILLIAM:- Awards, glory.
ANNA:- Oh, no.

1416
01:36:10,781 --> 01:36:14,101
ANNA:It's-- it's all nonsense, believe me.

1417
01:36:14,141 --> 01:36:16,981
ANNA:I'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but...

1418
01:36:17,061 --> 01:36:18,901
ANNA:nonsense it all is.

1419
01:36:20,981 --> 01:36:23,381
ANNA:Well, um--

1420
01:36:23,421 --> 01:36:28,261
ANNA:Yesterday was our last day of filming,
so... I'm leaving.

1421
01:36:30,301 --> 01:36:33,621
ANNA:But, um--

1422
01:36:33,701 --> 01:36:37,182
ANNA:I brought this for you from home,

1423
01:36:37,262 --> 01:36:39,382
ANNA:so I thought I'd give it to you.

1424
01:36:40,782 --> 01:36:43,582
WILLIAM:Thank you.

1425
01:36:43,662 --> 01:36:45,502
WILLIAM:Shall I--

1426
01:36:45,582 --> 01:36:48,062
ANNA:Oh, no, don't open it now.
I'll be embarrassed.

1427
01:36:50,782 --> 01:36:54,062
WILLIAM:Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

1428
01:36:54,102 --> 01:36:58,422
ANNA:Actually, I had it in my apartment,
and I thought you'd--

1429
01:37:00,702 --> 01:37:03,383
ANNA:But when it came to it,
I didn't know how to call,

1430
01:37:03,463 --> 01:37:06,423
ANNA:having behaved so badly.

1431
01:37:06,503 --> 01:37:08,343
ANNA:Twice.

1432
01:37:09,903 --> 01:37:13,903
ANNA:So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

1433
01:37:13,943 --> 01:37:18,103
ANNA:Then you came and... I figured--

1434
01:37:21,623 --> 01:37:23,863
ANNA:The thing is--

1435
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,783
ANNA:The thing is--

1436
01:37:28,463 --> 01:37:31,223
WILLIAM:What? What is the thing?

1437
01:37:32,424 --> 01:37:34,664
WILLIAM:Don't even think about it.
Go away immediately.

1438
01:37:34,744 --> 01:37:37,264
- Go away.
MR. SMITH:- Right.

1439
01:37:37,344 --> 01:37:39,224
MR. SMITH:Sorry.

1440
01:37:41,384 --> 01:37:43,704
WILLIAM:You were saying?

1441
01:37:46,104 --> 01:37:49,424
ANNA:Yes.

1442
01:37:49,504 --> 01:37:52,224
ANNA:I have to go away today, but l...

1443
01:37:52,304 --> 01:37:55,464
ANNA:wondered if I didn't...

1444
01:37:55,544 --> 01:37:59,744
ANNA:whether you might
let me see you a little,

1445
01:37:59,824 --> 01:38:02,585
ANNA:or... a lot, maybe.

1446
01:38:05,705 --> 01:38:08,505
ANNA:See if you could like me again.

1447
01:38:08,545 --> 01:38:10,905
WILLIAM:But yesterday
that actor asked you who I was,

1448
01:38:10,945 --> 01:38:13,585
WILLIAM:and you just
dismissed me out of hand.

1449
01:38:14,905 --> 01:38:17,905
WILLIAM:I heard.

1450
01:38:17,945 --> 01:38:21,025
WILLIAM:You had a microphone.
I had headphones.

1451
01:38:21,105 --> 01:38:23,025
ANNA:You expect me
to tell the truth about my life...

1452
01:38:23,065 --> 01:38:25,585
ANNA:to the most indiscreet man
in England?

1453
01:38:26,945 --> 01:38:29,186
MARTIN:Uh, excuse me.

1454
01:38:29,266 --> 01:38:31,586
MARTIN:It's your mother on the phone.

1455
01:38:34,266 --> 01:38:36,306
WILLIAM:Will you tell her
I'll ring her back?

1456
01:38:36,346 --> 01:38:39,346
MARTIN:I've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

1457
01:38:39,386 --> 01:38:41,306
MARTIN:and it's now been about 24 hours...

1458
01:38:41,346 --> 01:38:44,666
MARTIN:and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in color and--

1459
01:38:44,706 --> 01:38:48,306
WILLIAM:Right, right. Yeah.
Perfect timing, as ever.

1460
01:38:50,426 --> 01:38:53,106
WILLIAM:Martin, hold the fort a second.

1461
01:38:53,146 --> 01:38:55,426
WILLIAM:Uh, yes. All right.

1462
01:39:00,347 --> 01:39:02,787
MARTIN:Um, could I just say--

1463
01:39:02,867 --> 01:39:07,707
MARTIN:[ Chuckles ] I thought Ghost
was the most wonderful film.

1464
01:39:08,907 --> 01:39:11,467
ANNA:- Is that right?
MARTIN:- Oh, yes.

1466
01:39:14,547 --> 01:39:18,267
MARTIN:Um, I've always wondered...

1467
01:39:18,347 --> 01:39:21,427
MARTIN:what Patrick Swayze's like
in-- in-- in real life.

1468
01:39:21,467 --> 01:39:24,987
ANNA:I can't say that I know Patrick
all that well.

1469
01:39:25,067 --> 01:39:27,228
MARTIN:He wasn't that friendly during filming?

1470
01:39:27,308 --> 01:39:32,508
ANNA:Well, I'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.

1471
01:39:34,908 --> 01:39:37,148
MARTIN:Oh. Oh, right.

1472
01:39:37,228 --> 01:39:39,068
MARTIN:Sorry.

1473
01:39:40,668 --> 01:39:43,788
MARTIN:Always been a bit of an ass.
[ Chuckling ]

1474
01:39:43,868 --> 01:39:46,708
MARTIN:Um, anyway-- Um--

1475
01:39:46,748 --> 01:39:48,628
MARTIN:Well, it was lovely to meet you.

1476
01:39:48,668 --> 01:39:51,028
MARTIN:I'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

1477
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:54,549
MARTIN:And Demi's, of course.

1478
01:39:56,989 --> 01:39:59,109
WILLIAM:Sorry.

1479
01:39:59,189 --> 01:40:00,949
ANNA:WILLIAM:That's fine.

1480
01:40:01,029 --> 01:40:04,669
ANNA:There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

1481
01:40:06,869 --> 01:40:09,909
WILLIAM:Anna, look, um--

1482
01:40:09,949 --> 01:40:13,589
WILLIAM:I'm a fairly levelheaded bloke,

1483
01:40:13,669 --> 01:40:17,389
WILLIAM:not often in and out of love.

1484
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:19,509
WILLIAM:But, uh--

1485
01:40:23,870 --> 01:40:26,150
WILLIAM:Can I just say no to your...

1486
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:30,390
WILLIAM:kind request and, uh, leave it at that?

1487
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:36,830
ANNA:Yes.

1488
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:40,310
ANNA:Fine. Of course. I--

1489
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:42,350
ANNA:Of course.

1490
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:46,910
ANNA:I'll just be going, then.
It was nice to see you.

1491
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:49,790
WILLIAM:The thing is,

1492
01:40:49,870 --> 01:40:53,191
WILLIAM:with you I'm in real... danger.

1493
01:40:53,271 --> 01:40:56,311
WILLIAM:It seems like a... perfect situation,

1494
01:40:56,391 --> 01:40:59,711
WILLIAM:apart from that
foul temper of yours, but...

1495
01:40:59,791 --> 01:41:04,151
WILLIAM:my relatively inexperienced heart
would, I fear, not...

1496
01:41:04,231 --> 01:41:06,911
WILLIAM:recover, uh, if I was...

1497
01:41:06,991 --> 01:41:10,871
WILLIAM:once again cast aside,
as I would absolutely expect to be.

1498
01:41:10,951 --> 01:41:15,911
WILLIAM:There are just too many pictures of you,
too many films.

1499
01:41:15,991 --> 01:41:19,191
WILLIAM:You'd go and I'd be, uh,

1500
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:21,792
WILLIAM:well, buggered, basically.

1501
01:41:23,232 --> 01:41:26,072
ANNA:That really is a real no, isn't it?

1502
01:41:26,112 --> 01:41:30,632
WILLIAM:I live in Notting Hill.
You live in... Beverly Hills.

1503
01:41:30,712 --> 01:41:32,552
WILLIAM:Everyone in the world
knows who you are.

1504
01:41:32,632 --> 01:41:36,192
WILLIAM:My mother has trouble
remembering my name.

1505
01:41:36,272 --> 01:41:38,112
ANNA:Fine.

1506
01:41:39,912 --> 01:41:44,072
ANNA:Fine. Good decision.
Good decision.

1507
01:41:47,632 --> 01:41:51,033
ANNA:The fame thing isn't really real,
you know?

1508
01:41:54,673 --> 01:41:58,153
ANNA:And don't forget I'm--

1509
01:41:58,233 --> 01:42:01,873
ANNA:I'm also just a girl...

1510
01:42:01,953 --> 01:42:05,913
ANNA:standing in front of a boy...

1511
01:42:05,993 --> 01:42:08,473
ANNA:asking him to love her.

1512
01:42:18,914 --> 01:42:20,754
Good-bye.

1513
01:42:42,194 --> 01:42:44,554
WILLIAM:So what do you think?
Good move?

1514
01:42:44,594 --> 01:42:46,795
HONEY:[ Honey ]
Yeah, good move.

1515
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:49,475
HONEY:I mean, when all's said and done,
she's nothing special.

1516
01:42:49,515 --> 01:42:51,395
HONEY:I saw her taking her trousers down,

1517
01:42:51,435 --> 01:42:54,195
HONEY:and I definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

1518
01:42:54,275 --> 01:42:56,995
BELLA:Good decision, yeah.

1519
01:42:57,035 --> 01:42:59,395
BELLA:All actresses are as mad as snakes.

1520
01:42:59,435 --> 01:43:02,395
WILLIAM:- Tones, what do you reckon?
TONY:- Never met her, never want to.

1521
01:43:02,475 --> 01:43:06,035
WILLIAM:- Brilliant. Max?
MAX:- Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.

1522
01:43:06,115 --> 01:43:08,715
WILLIAM:Great. Thanks. Brilliant.

1523
01:43:09,995 --> 01:43:12,395
SPIKE:[ Panting ]
I was called and I came. What's up?

1524
01:43:12,475 --> 01:43:14,556
HONEY:William's just turned down Anna Scott.

1525
01:43:16,116 --> 01:43:18,916
SPIKE:You daft prick.

1526
01:43:18,956 --> 01:43:22,236
No, no.
No, no, it's actually quite sensible.

1527
01:43:25,436 --> 01:43:29,036
BELLA:That painting
isn't the original, is it?

1528
01:43:29,116 --> 01:43:31,596
WILLIAM:Um, you know,
I think it might be, yeah.

1529
01:43:34,396 --> 01:43:36,676
BERNIE:But she said
she wanted to go out with you.

1530
01:43:39,116 --> 01:43:41,916
WILLIAM:- Yeah.
BERNIE:- Well, that's nice.

1531
01:43:43,437 --> 01:43:46,397
WILLIAM:What?

1532
01:43:46,477 --> 01:43:48,517
BERNIE:Well, you know,

1533
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:52,557
BERNIE:anyone saying they wanna go out with you
is pretty great, isn't it?

1534
01:43:58,117 --> 01:44:00,677
WILLIAM:It was...

1535
01:44:00,757 --> 01:44:02,957
WILLIAM:sort of... sweet, actually.

1536
01:44:02,997 --> 01:44:05,837
WILLIAM:Um, I mean,
I know she's an actress and all that...

1537
01:44:05,877 --> 01:44:11,558
WILLIAM:so she can... deliver a line, but, um,

1538
01:44:11,598 --> 01:44:14,038
WILLIAM:she said she might be
as famous as she can be,

1539
01:44:14,118 --> 01:44:16,878
WILLIAM:but also that she was...

1540
01:44:16,918 --> 01:44:20,118
WILLIAM:just a girl...

1541
01:44:20,198 --> 01:44:24,398
WILLIAM:standing in front of a boy...

1542
01:44:24,438 --> 01:44:26,798
WILLIAM:asking him... to love her.

1543
01:44:41,319 --> 01:44:44,599
WILLIAM:Oh, sod a dog. I've made
the wrong decision, haven't I?

1544
01:44:46,559 --> 01:44:48,359
Yeah.

1545
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:51,239
WILLIAM:Max, how fast is your car?

1546
01:44:51,559 --> 01:44:54,719
- # Hey #

1547
01:44:54,799 --> 01:44:58,439
MAX:- Good luck!
- If anyone gets in our way,
we have small nuclear devices.

1548
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:00,279
- Where to?
BERNIE:- All I can think is The Ritz.

1549
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:02,839
MAX:- Where's Bella?
HONEY:- She's not coming.

1550
01:45:02,919 --> 01:45:05,959
MAX:- Oh, sod that. Bernie, in the back.
- What?

1552
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,800
- Max, I'm okay.

1553
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,880
MAX:- Come on, babe.

1557
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,840
BELLA:- [ Bella ] Which way are you going?

1558
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,960
MAX:Down Kensington Church Street, then
Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.

1559
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,560
BELLA:- No, crazy. Go along Bayswater.
HONEY:- That's right. Then Park Lane.

1560
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,600
BERNIE:No, straight down to the Cromwell Road,
then left.

1561
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,600
WILLIAM:- No!

1562
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:37,481
MAX:Stop right there!
I will decide the route. All right?

1563
01:45:37,521 --> 01:45:39,681
Sorry, Max.

1564
01:45:39,761 --> 01:45:42,561
MAX:James Bond never has to put up
with this sort of shit.

1567
01:45:49,361 --> 01:45:51,801
- [ Bella ] Turn right!

1568
01:45:51,881 --> 01:45:53,321
- I can't. It's one way.
- Do a U-turn.

1569
01:45:53,361 --> 01:45:56,041
- Oh, sod it. Hold on.

1572
01:46:01,681 --> 01:46:04,721
- Brilliant!

1575
01:46:09,202 --> 01:46:12,482
BERNIE:- Bloody hell, this is fun!

1576
01:46:12,562 --> 01:46:14,402
- Sorry.

1577
01:46:14,482 --> 01:46:16,682
WILLIAM:Hi.
Is Miss Scott staying here?

1578
01:46:16,722 --> 01:46:20,002
RITZ MAN:- No, sir.
WILLIAM:- How 'bout Miss Flintstone?

1579
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:22,962
RITZ MAN:- No, sir.
WILLIAM:- Uh, Bambi?

1580
01:46:23,042 --> 01:46:26,042
WILLIAM:- No, sir.
WILLIAM:- Or, um--

1581
01:46:26,122 --> 01:46:30,082
WILLIAM:I don't know.
Beavis or Butt-head?

1582
01:46:30,162 --> 01:46:32,882
RITZ MAN:No, sir.

1583
01:46:32,922 --> 01:46:35,483
WILLIAM:Thanks. Thanks.

1584
01:46:35,563 --> 01:46:38,083
RITZ MAN:There was a Miss Pocahontas,

1585
01:46:38,163 --> 01:46:40,683
RITZ MAN:but she checked out
about an hour ago.

1586
01:46:40,723 --> 01:46:43,363
RITZ MAN:I believe she's holding
a press conference at the Savoy...

1587
01:46:43,443 --> 01:46:46,363
RITZ MAN:before flying to America.

1588
01:46:50,483 --> 01:46:52,363
BERNIE:We have liftoff.

1590
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:03,004
You have message for Takiama?

1591
01:47:03,084 --> 01:47:05,164
I'll just check, sir.

1595
01:47:27,324 --> 01:47:29,604
SPIKE:Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.

1596

1611
01:48:15,486 --> 01:48:18,046

1612
01:48:18,126 --> 01:48:21,126

1620
01:48:45,367 --> 01:48:47,207

1622

will not be publicizing her next film?

1623
01:49:05,648 --> 01:49:07,768
No, it absolutely
does not mean that.

1624
01:49:07,848 --> 01:49:09,968
She'll be abiding by
all her present commitments.

1625
01:49:10,008 --> 01:49:13,768

1629
01:49:20,088 --> 01:49:23,288

ANNA:No time at all.
I leave tonight.

1633
01:49:30,449 --> 01:49:35,169
JEREMY:Which is why we have to round things
up now, so final questions, please.

1634
01:49:35,249 --> 01:49:36,889

1638
01:49:46,329 --> 01:49:50,009

1639
01:49:50,089 --> 01:49:54,690
ANNA:Though I will say, from my experience,
rumors about Jeff do tend to be true.

1641
01:49:57,290 --> 01:50:01,130
QUESTIONER 3:Yeah. The last time you were here, there
were some fairly graphic photographs...

1642
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:05,050
QUESTIONER 3:taken of you
with a young English guy.

1643

WILLIAM:the two of you...

1650
01:50:32,131 --> 01:50:35,171
WILLIAM:might be more than just good friends?

1651
01:50:36,891 --> 01:50:41,451
ANNA:I hoped there would be, but no,
I'm... assured there aren't.

1652
01:50:41,531 --> 01:50:44,931
WILLIAM:- But what would you say if--
JEREMY:- Sorry. Just the one question, please.

1653
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:47,491
ANNA:No, it's all right.
You were saying.

1654
01:50:49,171 --> 01:50:52,092

1658
01:50:59,932 --> 01:51:02,492

1659
01:51:02,532 --> 01:51:06,332
WILLIAM:Mr. Thacker realized he'd been
a daft prick...

1661
01:51:08,692 --> 01:51:11,972
WILLIAM:and got down on his knees and...
begged you to reconsider,

1662
01:51:12,052 --> 01:51:15,652
WILLIAM:whether you would, in fact, then...

1663
01:51:15,732 --> 01:51:17,692
